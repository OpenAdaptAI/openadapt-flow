"""Independent ground truth: read the sqlite FILE directly, judge every table.

This is path (c) of the harness -- the privileged judge of what ACTUALLY
persisted. It is deliberately independent of both oracles:

- It bypasses the record service entirely and opens the sqlite file on its OWN
  read-only connection (``mode=ro``). A bug or lie in the service's read
  handler cannot fool it.
- It audits EVERY persisted system-of-record surface, discovered dynamically
  from ``sqlite_master`` -- NOT a hardcoded table pair. If a new business
  surface appeared (a third clinical table, an audit-log, an outbound-queue
  table), the judge would audit it automatically. The one table it excludes is
  the app's own ``banner`` echo (``_UI_ECHO_TABLES``): that surface is the
  application's self-report -- the very thing the SCREEN oracle reads -- so
  auditing it as ground truth would be circular, not independent.
- It classifies the business effect with its OWN before/after row logic and its
  OWN per-table count-delta computation (:func:`_table_deltas`). It does NOT
  import or reuse the effect kit's ``audit_table_deltas``, and it does NOT
  restate the effect verifier's typed ``Effect`` contract. Code path and read
  path are both independent of the verifier.

The write's HTTP success flag never reaches this judge; it looks only at rows.

Disclosed limit (see ``EFFECT_E2E.md`` and the paper's Limitations). The judge
is open-world over the SQLite SYSTEM OF RECORD (every persisted SoR table), but
it cannot see an effect that lands OUTSIDE that database entirely -- an outbound
HL7/message-queue publish, a filesystem side-channel, a call to a downstream
service. No in-database audit can. And independence of code and read path is not
independence of SPECIFICATION: the judge and the effect contract encode the same
business intent (``TARGET_PATIENT`` / ``TARGET_TYPE`` / the intended note), so a
fault class no one thought to define is invisible to all three paths. So a
``0`` here means "zero silent-wrong-effects within the audited SQLite system of
record, under this fault taxonomy," not "zero silent-wrong-effects" in the
absolute.
