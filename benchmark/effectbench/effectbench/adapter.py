"""The adapter interface -- plug YOUR agent / system into EffectBench.

A third party makes their system runnable under EffectBench by implementing one
method: :class:`SystemUnderTest.run_task`. The benchmark owns the reference
system of record (synthetic MockMed), the tasks, and the independent oracle; the
system under test only has to *attempt each task's goal* against the reference
system and return its own (untrusted) self-report. EffectBench reads the TRUE
effect through the oracle -- never through the system under test -- and computes
its SWER.

The contract, in full::

    @runtime_checkable
    class SystemUnderTest(Protocol):
        name: str
        def run_task(self, task: TaskSpec, env: EnvHandle,
                     *, params: Mapping[str, str]) -> AgentReport: ...

The system under test receives:

- ``task`` -- the natural-language ``goal`` (intent, NEVER a step list -- a
  fairness requirement) plus the substrate and category;
- ``env`` -- an :class:`EnvHandle` to drive the reference system and read back
  ONLY the screen banner (the untrusted witness). ``env`` never exposes the
  oracle's read path;
- ``params`` -- the run's trial-unique payload (the note / key it must write).

It returns an :class:`~effectbench.schema.AgentReport` -- what it asserts /
what the screen rendered. The oracle, not this report, decides the outcome.

Two reference baselines ship here so a third party has a runnable template and
so the reference result is reproducible:

- :class:`ScreenOnlySUT` -- trusts the banner (no effect check). Exhibits a
  non-zero SWER: the arm the benchmark indicts.
- :class:`EffectVerifiedSUT` -- consults its OWN independent record-readback
  verifier and refuses to claim success unless the write is CONFIRMED. Reaches
  SWER 0 -- at an over-halt cost the benchmark also reports.

An honest run reports SWER and over-halt JOINTLY: an agent trivially reaches
SWER 0 by halting on everything (over-halt 100%).
