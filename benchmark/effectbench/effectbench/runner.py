"""The runner -- evaluate a :class:`~effectbench.adapter.SystemUnderTest`.

Given a system under test, the runner drives it against a
:class:`~effectbench.provider.BenchmarkProvider` -- a pluggable reference system
of record + its INDEPENDENT ground-truth oracle -- and scores each ``(task x
trial)`` into one :class:`~effectbench.schema.EpisodeRecord`. Every headline
(:func:`~effectbench.metrics.summarize`) is a pure function of those rows.

The DEFAULT provider is :class:`MockMedProvider`, the synthetic MockMed reference
fixture (marked REFERENCE-ONLY; see its docstring), so ``evaluate(sut)`` is
exactly ``evaluate_provider(sut, MockMedProvider())``. A third party swaps in
their own provider to score EffectBench on a system of record the benchmark
authors did NOT build -- see :mod:`effectbench.provider`.

Fairness / isolation by construction:

- the harness oracle and any product verifier the SUT may reach are DISTINCT
  instances built over the same store (different objects / read paths);
- the SUT receives only the task goal (never a step list) + the trial-unique
  params; it cannot reach the harness oracle;
- an UNREADABLE oracle is a harness condition, not an agent outcome -- the
  episode is dropped, never scored as success or SWER.
