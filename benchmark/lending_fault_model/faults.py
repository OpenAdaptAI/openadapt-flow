"""Fault classes and the ground-truth outcome taxonomy for the lending study.

This is the NON-healthcare mirror of ``benchmark/fault_model/faults.py``. It is
the single source of truth shared by the lending runner
(``benchmark/lending_fault_model/run.py``) and the harness tests
(``tests/e2e/test_lending_fault_model.py``). It defines:

- the transactional fault classes injected at the persistence boundary
  (realized by ``openadapt_flow/mockloan/fault_server.py`` + the flag-gated
  ``?fault=`` hook in ``mockloan/static/app.js``), and
- ``classify()``, which assigns each replay an outcome judged ONLY by the
  backend ledger (ground truth) and whether the replay halted - never by the
  replay's own vision-based self-report.

The consequential write is authorizing a disbursement of funds to a borrower's
loan - an irreversible money-movement write. The outcome taxonomy is identical
to the clinical study's (a record system must never silently get a consequential
write wrong); only the record shape (loan/product/memo vs patient/type/note)
and the domain stakes (double-paying a borrower vs a duplicate chart) differ.

Outcome taxonomy (judged by effect, not by the screen):

- ``SUCCESS``            -- ran to completion and booked exactly one correct,
                            complete disbursement to the target loan.
- ``SAFE-HALT``          -- stopped without completing AND left no side effect
                            (no money moved wrongly). The desired failure mode.
- ``WRONG-ACTION``       -- a wrong write actually landed: a duplicate
                            disbursement (borrower paid twice), a lost update
                            over a concurrent hold, or a wrong/partial row that
                            persisted after a halt.
- ``FALSE-ABORT``        -- the disbursement DID land but the replay reported
                            failure. No silent bad write, but a human retry
                            would double-pay, and the effect is unverified.
- ``UNDETECTED-FAILURE`` -- the replay reported SUCCESS but the disbursement did
                            not happen, or happened wrong (phantom success /
                            partial save). The screen lied and nothing caught
                            it. The most dangerous class for a record system.

Honest scope of the ground-truth oracle (why 0 is not free). This browser study
judges by ``GET /api/db`` over the disbursements ledger. That single read path
catches every fault that lands on THAT surface, but a single out-of-band record
oracle is NOT sufficient in general: a write to a surface it does not read is
invisible to it. The companion SWER study
(``benchmark/lending_fault_model/swer.py``) makes this explicit with a
``collateral`` fault (class C8) that books the correct disbursement AND a
spurious fee to a SEPARATE fees / general-ledger surface. A single-surface oracle
leaves a residual silent-wrong-effect on exactly that class (the lending analog
of the clinical study's 9/90 single-surface residual); only a COMPLETE read path
over every mutable surface reaches 0. Both MockLoan and the clinical MockMed are
SYNTHETIC apps built by the same team - a matching residual across the two is
suggestive of generalizability, not proof.
