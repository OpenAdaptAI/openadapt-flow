"""Lending (MockLoan) Silent Wrong-Effect Rate: screen-only vs effect-verified.

The effect-verified companion to ``benchmark/lending_fault_model/run.py``. Where
``run.py`` replays the compiled bundle through the REAL ``Replayer`` under the
screen-only postcondition contract (and measures how often that silently
mishandles a transactional fault), THIS module measures the same faults through
the shared EffectBench scoring contract
(:func:`openadapt_flow.benchmark.effectbench.score_episode`) under a THREE-arm
ladder that mirrors the clinical ``effect_e2e`` study (screen / single-surface /
complete-read-path), so the two domains are directly comparable:

- ``screen_only`` - the deceptive witness: the agent believes the rendered
  "Disbursement authorized" banner.
- ``effect_verify_single`` - the agent consults its OWN independent
  :class:`~openadapt_flow.runtime.effects.RestRecordVerifier` reading a SINGLE
  surface, the disbursements ledger at ``GET /api/disbursements`` (a path the SPA
  never calls), and halts unless the disbursement is CONFIRMED. This is the
  lending analog of the clinical single-surface REST oracle (encounters only): it
  catches every same-surface fault but is BLIND to a ``collateral`` write that
  lands on the separate fees / general-ledger surface, so it leaves a residual
  silent-wrong-effect on exactly that one class - the honest 9/90-style residual.
- ``effect_verify_full`` - the same agent reading the COMPLETE read path over
  every mutable surface at ``GET /api/db`` (disbursements + fees). It sees the
  collateral row and drives the residual to 0.

Only ``reported_success`` (and the arm's own read path) differs between the arms.
A benchmark-local read-only SQLite oracle is the separate ground-truth path
judging all three arms. It discovers business tables and uses its own row/delta
classifier rather than the runtime effect-kit classifier. An injected fault classifies as
``silent_wrong_effect`` under
``screen_only``; every non-collateral fault is caught under BOTH effect arms; the
``collateral`` fault is a residual silent-wrong-effect under
``effect_verify_single`` (invisible to a single-surface oracle) and caught under
``effect_verify_full`` - the headline this second domain now shows with the SAME
honest residual the clinical study reports.

Oracle independence: the ground-truth oracle opens the persisted SQLite ledger
read-only before and after the write, bypassing both HTTP verifier paths, and
never trusts the agent's self-report or screen. Every trial binds a TRIAL-UNIQUE
memo (and idempotency key), so the oracle checks THIS run's exact write and
cross-trial contamination is detectable. The C6 wrong-record task exercises
post-action identity-sensitive readback: a decoy loan is seeded, a blind write
funds the wrong loan, and the trial-unique persisted row is found by
memo/product before its ``loan_id`` is checked against the intended record.

Both MockMed and MockLoan are SYNTHETIC apps built by the same team, so a
matching residual across the two is SUGGESTIVE of generalizability, not proof.

No model calls, no browser, localhost only - runs in CI. Every fault is injected
deterministically at the boundary and the writes are fixed, so run-to-run
variance is ~0: results are reported as a coverage matrix over scenarios, not a
sampled rate.

Usage::

    python -m benchmark.lending_fault_model.swer            # write results + md
    python -m benchmark.lending_fault_model.swer --print    # print, don't write
    python -m benchmark.lending_fault_model.swer --trials 5

_MD_HEADER = """# Lending (MockLoan) Silent Wrong-Effect Rate - screen / single-surface / complete read path

The non-healthcare replication of the SWER headline on a second system of
record, run as the SAME three-arm ladder as the clinical `effect_e2e` study so
the two domains are directly comparable: screen-only, a SINGLE-surface oracle
(disbursements ledger only, `GET /api/disbursements`), and the COMPLETE read path
over every mutable surface (disbursements + fees, `GET /api/db`). A separate
benchmark-local ground truth judges all three arms through a read-only SQLite
connection and its own row/table-delta classifier, never either HTTP response,
the runtime effect classifier, the screen, or an arm's self-report. Every trial
binds a trial-unique memo + idempotency key. Zero model calls.

**The primary gate is SILENT WRONG-EFFECT - reporting/rendering success while the
ledger disagrees.** A single out-of-band oracle collapses it to a residual on
exactly one class (a collateral write to a surface it does not read); only a
complete read path over every mutable surface reaches 0. `wrong_action` is
reported separately because post-action verification can detect an incorrect
effect after persistence but cannot retroactively prevent it. Over-halt (halting
when the write was actually fine) is the safe availability cost.

Both MockLoan and the clinical MockMed are SYNTHETIC apps built by the same team.
A matching single-surface residual across the two domains is SUGGESTIVE of
generalizability, not proof; the point it earns is narrower and honest: a single
out-of-band record oracle is not sufficient - 0 requires a read path covering
every mutable surface.
