# openIMIS claims-intake reference environment (synthetic and pinned)

Status: **reference/demo environment — NOT a benchmark**. This directory gives
OpenAdapt an INSURANCE vertical mirror of the healthcare (OpenEMR) and lending
(Frappe Lending) reference environments: a real open-source insurance system,
run locally from digest-pinned images, in which one health-facility claim is
entered through the browser UI (claims intake), recorded once, compiled, and
replayed — with success established only by a direct SQL read of the claim
row, never by pixels or actor self-report.

There is no timing matrix, no agent arm, and no publication protocol here. Any
future reliability claim would need the full matched protocol the Frappe
Lending and OpenEMR benchmarks define (paid agent arm, 10 fresh trials per
cell, snapshot-reset baselines). Nothing in this directory is publication
evidence.

## The application

[openIMIS](https://openimis.org/) (AGPL-3.0) is the open-source insurance
management system used by national health-insurance and social-protection
schemes. Its claims module is a real payer-side claims-intake surface: a
health-facility claim references an insuree (policyholder), visit dates, an
ICD diagnosis, and tariffed services/items, and is saved into claim status
"Entered" — the step before checking and adjudication.

It is a browser UI over a supported GraphQL API, so — exactly as the Frappe
Lending README notes for lending — a real openIMIS deployment should prefer
the API control arm. The browser demonstration isolates the value of compiled
replay when a UI path is required, and stands in for the many commercial
claims platforms that expose no such API.

## Synthetic data only

* The stack loads the upstream openIMIS **demo dataset**, a fictional fixture
  shipped by the openIMIS project (invented regions such as "Tahida",
  facilities such as "Vida District Hospital", fictional insurees, tariffs,
  and the demo actor credential `Admin`).
* `bootstrap` adds one more synthetic policyholder — **Avery Doe, insuree
  no. 999000001**, with an in-force policy through 2027-12-31 — so the
  recorded claim shows active coverage. All values are invented.
* Everything binds to `127.0.0.1` only; generated stack secrets live in the
  ignored `out/state/` directory.

Any published screenshot or clip must be captured from this synthetic fixture,
labelled "openIMIS reference environment", and must not imply a customer
deployment, production readiness, or a completed benchmark.

## The demonstrated workflow

Authentication and opening the blank claim form (fixing the health facility
`VIHOS001` and claim administrator context) are declared unmeasured setup,
mirroring the Frappe Lending setup boundary. The recorded task is:

> On the blank Health Facility Claim form, enter insuree no. `999000001`
> (which resolves the synthetic policyholder and her active policy), a claim
> number (parameter), main diagnosis `A000`, an explanation note (parameter),
> and service `A1` (General Consultation, auto-tariffed); save the claim.

The compiled bundle parameterizes the three values a claims clerk varies per
claim: `insurance_no`, `claim_no`, and `explanation`. Replay substitutes a
fresh `claim_no` (the claim-form input accepts at most 8 characters). The SQL
oracle then requires **exactly one** non-voided `tblClaim` row with that code,
in status 2 ("Entered"), for the demonstrated insuree and health facility — a
duplicate or missing row fails the run loudly.

## Pinning

`environment.lock.json` pins every image by digest (openIMIS 25.10 backend /
frontend / demo-dataset PostgreSQL, plus Redis and RabbitMQ). `compose.yml`
refuses to start without those digests supplied, and the driver script
supplies them from the lock file. The compose topology and the vendored
`conf/nginx/` templates come from openIMIS's own distribution repo
([openimis-dist_dkr](https://github.com/openimis/openimis-dist_dkr) commit
`cd6220d1f0578e56a589c47953250c2ad3d0caa5`), trimmed to the services the
claims workflow needs (no OpenSearch/dashboards/certbot). openIMIS source and
configuration remain attributed to the upstream project under AGPL-3.0.

The 25.10 images publish `linux/amd64` only; on Apple Silicon they run under
Docker Desktop's Rosetta emulation (verified 2026-07-17: first bring-up
including migrations and demo-dataset load completed in a few minutes).

## Reproduction commands

Requirements: Docker-compatible API with Compose v2, network for the one-time
pinned image pull, and the repo's `.venv`.

```bash
# Start the pinned stack (loopback-only; first run pulls + migrates + loads
# the synthetic demo dataset) and create the synthetic policyholder.
.venv/bin/python scripts/openimis_claims_demo.py up
.venv/bin/python scripts/openimis_claims_demo.py bootstrap

# Record the scripted claims-intake demonstration, compile it, replay it
# with a fresh claim number. Every replay is SQL-oracle-verified.
.venv/bin/python scripts/openimis_claims_demo.py record \
  --out benchmark/openimis_claims/out/recording --headed
.venv/bin/python scripts/openimis_claims_demo.py compile \
  --recording benchmark/openimis_claims/out/recording \
  --bundle benchmark/openimis_claims/out/bundle
.venv/bin/python scripts/openimis_claims_demo.py replay \
  --bundle benchmark/openimis_claims/out/bundle --headed

# Optional website-media capture (opt-in, unchanged recording/replay):
#   ... record --record-video benchmark/openimis_claims/out/video
#   ... replay --record-video benchmark/openimis_claims/out/video

.venv/bin/python scripts/openimis_claims_demo.py down            # stop
.venv/bin/python scripts/openimis_claims_demo.py down --volumes  # full reset
