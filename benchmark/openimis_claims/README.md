# openIMIS claims-intake reference environment (synthetic and pinned)

Status: **reference/demo environment — NOT a benchmark**. This directory gives
OpenAdapt an INSURANCE vertical mirror of the healthcare (OpenEMR) and lending
(Frappe Lending) reference environments: a real open-source insurance system,
run locally from digest-pinned images, in which one health-facility claim is
entered through the browser UI (claims intake), recorded once, compiled, and
replayed — with success established only by a direct SQL read of the claim
row, never by pixels or actor self-report.

On 2026-07-21 the **paid computer-use agent arm was run** on this environment,
so the insurance vertical is no longer agent-arm-free. On the pinned synthetic
reference, the `claude-sonnet-5` agent drove the same claim-intake task and was
scored by the same arm-independent effect contract:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| trials | 3 |
| primary outcome | 3/3 `correct` (exactly one 'Entered' claim for the synthetic policyholder each time) |
| over-halt | 0/3 |
| silent incorrect success | 0/3 (no duplicate / wrong / collateral claim) |
| model cost / run | $0.4793 (list price) |
| total model cost | $1.4380 |
| latency (wall) mean | 69.8 s |
| model | `claude-sonnet-5`, `computer_20251124`, <=30 actions/run, <=$1.50/run cap |

Raw per-run rows, environment fingerprints, application-specific
adapter/oracle wiring, and the detailed cost ledger are retained in the private
`OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-corpus` repository. The public generic cost-capped agent
mechanism remains in
`openadapt_flow/benchmark/agent_baseline.py`. See the
[aggregate report](../agent_arm_verticals/README.md).

There is still no full timing matrix and no publication protocol here: a
publication reliability claim would need the full matched protocol the Frappe
Lending and OpenEMR benchmarks define (compiled + agent + API arms, 10 fresh
trials per cell, snapshot-reset baselines). Nothing in this directory is
publication evidence.

## The application

[openIMIS](https://openimis.org/) (AGPL-3.0) is the open-source insurance
management system used by national health-insurance and social-protection
schemes. Its claims module is a real payer-side claims-intake surface: a
health-facility claim references an insuree (policyholder), visit dates, an
ICD diagnosis, and tariffed services/items, and is saved into claim status
"Entered" — the step before checking and adjudication.

It is a browser UI over a supported GraphQL API, so — exactly as the Frappe
Lending README notes for lending — a real openIMIS deployment should prefer
the API control arm. The browser demonstration isolates the value of compiled
replay when a UI path is required, and stands in for the many commercial
claims platforms that expose no such API.

## Synthetic data only

* The stack loads the upstream openIMIS **demo dataset**, a fictional fixture
  shipped by the openIMIS project (invented regions such as "Tahida",
  facilities such as "Vida District Hospital", fictional insurees, tariffs,
  and the demo actor credential `Admin`).
* `bootstrap` adds one more synthetic policyholder — **Avery Doe, insuree
  no. 999000001**, with an in-force policy through 2027-12-31 — so the
  recorded claim shows active coverage. All values are invented.
* Everything binds to `127.0.0.1` only; generated stack secrets live in the
  ignored `out/state/` directory.

Any published screenshot or clip must be captured from this synthetic fixture,
labelled "openIMIS reference environment", and must not imply a customer
deployment, production readiness, or a completed benchmark.

## The demonstrated workflow

Authentication and opening the blank claim form (fixing the health facility
`VIHOS001` and claim administrator context) are declared unmeasured setup,
mirroring the Frappe Lending setup boundary. The recorded task is:

> On the blank Health Facility Claim form, enter insuree no. `999000001`
> (which resolves the synthetic policyholder and her active policy), a claim
> number (parameter), main diagnosis `A000`, an explanation note (parameter),
> and service `A1` (General Consultation, auto-tariffed); save the claim.

The compiled bundle parameterizes the three values a claims clerk varies per
claim: `insurance_no`, `claim_no`, and `explanation`. Replay substitutes a
fresh `claim_no` (the claim-form input accepts at most 8 characters). The SQL
oracle then requires **exactly one** non-voided `tblClaim` row with that code,
in status 2 ("Entered"), for the demonstrated insuree and health facility — a
duplicate or missing row fails the run loudly.

## The eligibility-check workflow (effect-verified)

`scripts/openimis_eligibility_demo.py` demonstrates the second reference
workflow on the same stack: a front-office **coverage / eligibility check** —
look up a policyholder by insuree number in openIMIS's Insuree Enquiry,
confirm the policy panel and a service-eligibility answer, and **verify the
declared outcome against the system of record** with the effect-verifier kit
(`docs/EFFECT_KIT.md`) instead of trusting the screen.

Why the contract is the point: for a policyholder whose coverage has LAPSED,
the enquiry dialog still renders a service-eligibility thumbs-up next to the
selected service — a screen a hurried human (or any screen-scraping
automation) can misread as "covered". The committed
`deployment.eligibility.yaml` wires ONE read-only SELECT over openIMIS's own
policy, product-benefit, and service tables
(`fixture.py::ELIGIBILITY_ORACLE_SQL`; a unit test pins the two to each
other), executed as the dedicated read-only role
`oa_eligibility_oracle` (SELECT on exactly five tables,
`default_transaction_read_only=on` — the role, not the kit's statement
filter, is the real enforcement). The bundle's single `field_equals` outcome
contract binds to the run's `insurance_no` parameter and to the exact question
shown in the UI: service **A1 (General Consultation)** on **2026-07-21**.

The SELECT must yield exactly one policy/product/service row. It derives
`eligibility=Eligible` only when both the policy and insuree-policy link are
active and effective on the declared date, and the policy's product includes
the current A1 service. Missing, duplicate, expired, not-yet-effective, and
wrong-service rows all refuse; no mutation is invented for this read-only
workflow.

A replay for an eligible policyholder ends with the outcome CONFIRMED in
the run report's effect-verification section; a replay for the lapsed
policyholder completes the GUI lookup, then **HALTS** with
`field_equals REFUTED — eligibility 'Ineligible', expected 'Eligible'` instead of
reporting the check a success. Halt + evidence, never a guess.

`bootstrap` (below) adds three more synthetic policyholders: **Jordan Roe,
insuree no. 999000002** (policy expired 2026-05-31 — the halt scenario) and
**Sam Poe, insuree no. 999000003** (eligible for A1 on 2026-07-21), so the
green replay parameterizes onto a policyholder the demonstration never saw.
It also adds **Taylor Foe, insuree no. 999000004** (effective 2026-08-01) so
the not-yet-effective refusal is regression-tested. All values are invented.

```bash
# One-time: the SQL verifier needs a PostgreSQL DB-API driver.
uv pip install "psycopg[binary]"

.venv/bin/python scripts/openimis_eligibility_demo.py up         # same stack

```

Honesty box: this is a **contract-proven fixture demo** on synthetic data —
the same status the effect kit's SQL substrate documents. It is not a
benchmark, not a customer deployment, and not a claim about any commercial
payer portal; a real dental-office eligibility deployment would target the
payer portal / clearinghouse the office actually uses and would need its own
read-only oracle. Under the `permissive` policy the bundle certifies clean;
the stricter `clinical-write` policy still flags the two unlabeled dialog
clicks (compile-time confidence 0.70 < 0.80) and the parameter-typing step's
vacuous postcondition — accurate findings for an unattended-write posture,
acceptable for a demonstrated read-only check.

## Pinning

`environment.lock.json` pins every image by digest (openIMIS 25.10 backend /
frontend / demo-dataset PostgreSQL, plus Redis and RabbitMQ). `compose.yml`
refuses to start without those digests supplied, and the driver script
supplies them from the lock file. The compose topology and the vendored
`conf/nginx/` templates come from openIMIS's own distribution repo
([openimis-dist_dkr](https://github.com/openimis/openimis-dist_dkr) commit
`cd6220d1f0578e56a589c47953250c2ad3d0caa5`), trimmed to the services the
claims workflow needs (no OpenSearch/dashboards/certbot). openIMIS source and
configuration remain attributed to the upstream project under AGPL-3.0.

The 25.10 images publish `linux/amd64` only; on Apple Silicon they run under
Docker Desktop's Rosetta emulation (verified 2026-07-17: first bring-up
including migrations and demo-dataset load completed in a few minutes).

## Mixed-license boundary

OpenAdapt Flow's original code remains MIT-licensed under the repository-root
`LICENSE`. The local `compose.yml` topology and four configuration files under
`conf/nginx/` are adapted from the openIMIS Docker distribution at exact
commit `cd6220d1f0578e56a589c47953250c2ad3d0caa5` and remain licensed under
`AGPL-3.0-only`:

* `compose.yml` (from upstream `compose.base.yml`, `compose.postgresql.yml`,
  and `compose.cache.yml`)
* `conf/nginx/openimis.conf`
* `conf/nginx/locations/backend.loc`
* `conf/nginx/locations/frontend.loc`
* `conf/nginx/variables/var.conf`

Each file carries its exact upstream path and SPDX identifier. The complete
license is included at
[`conf/nginx/LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.md`](conf/nginx/LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.md), and the
aggregate Git-checkout/GitHub-generated-source-archive boundary is recorded in
the root
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). The MIT license
does not relicense those adapted files.
