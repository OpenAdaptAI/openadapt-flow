"""Pinned local openIMIS claims-intake reference environment.

This is the reproducible INSURANCE reference environment for OpenAdapt: a real
open-source health-insurance management system (openIMIS, AGPL-3.0, used by
national health-insurance schemes) run locally from digest-pinned images, in
which a health-facility claim is entered through the browser UI and verified
against the database — the same record -> compile -> replay loop the OpenEMR
(healthcare) and Frappe Lending (lending) reference environments demonstrate.

It is a DEMO/reference environment, not a benchmark:

* no matched timing matrix or publication protocol; a separate 3-trial paid
  agent run is reported only as small-N aggregate engineering evidence;
* the success oracle is a direct SQL read of the claim row (actor self-report
  and pixels never establish success), plus an exact one-row cardinality check;
* every value is synthetic. The upstream openIMIS demo dataset is a fictional
  fixture (invented regions, facilities, insurees, tariffs), and the bootstrap
  adds synthetic policyholders with active, expired, and future-dated policies
  so both confirmed and refused outcomes can be exercised.

Mutable state (generated secrets) is confined to ``state_dir``. All published
ports bind to loopback only.
