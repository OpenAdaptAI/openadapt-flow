# Compiled-program visualizer

See what a demonstration compiled into. A compiled bundle is a governed
program. Each step states how the runtime resolves its target, whether an
identity gate applies, what screen and effect checks apply, and where the run
must halt.

![Public-safe Program Workbench with the exact loop edges and selected-step inspector](program-workbench.png)

The HTML view has three linked views:

- **Program map** renders the exact emitted edge targets. It keeps loop-back,
  branch, exception, and sequence edges distinct.
- **Evidence lanes** compares the declared resolution, identity, actuation,
  screen, effect, and stop contracts for each step.
- **Stop rules** isolates the steps that can refuse an action.

The view does not show a live verdict without an exact run trace. A declared
check is a compile-time requirement. It is not evidence that the check passed.

## One spec, three surfaces

The engine is the single source of truth. `openadapt_flow.visualize`
**emits a serializable _program-graph spec_** from a compiled bundle; every
surface renders that spec and none of them re-parse the bundle IR:

- **CLI** (`openadapt-flow visualize`) writes self-contained HTML, Mermaid, or JSON.
- **Cloud** (`app.openadapt.ai`) uses an interactive React view over the same spec.
- **Desktop** uses a local React view over the qualification graph projection.

The spec is versioned and has a committed JSON Schema
(`schemas/program-graph-v1.json`) so non-Python surfaces validate the same
shape. A sample emitted spec lives at
[`docs/showcase-openemr/program-graph.json`](showcase-openemr/program-graph.json).

### Spec shape (v1)

```
ProgramGraphSpec
├─ spec_version
├─ bundle: BundleMeta      # name, schema version, PHI/encryption flags,
│                          # provenance/certification, params, rollup counts
├─ nodes: [GraphNode]      # one per compiled step / program state
│   ├─ kind                # action | branch | business_decision | loop |
│   │                      # subflow_call | terminal
│   ├─ title, action, risk # intent, click/type/…, reversible|irreversible
│   ├─ resolution          # the target-resolution LADDER + which rung is top
│   ├─ identity            # armed? phi-free? unarmed-reason?
│   ├─ effects             # system-of-record checks
│   ├─ postconditions      # vision verification kinds
│   ├─ guard / wait_until  # control-flow preconditions
│   ├─ halts               # fail-safe HALT points this node introduces
│   └─ badges
└─ edges: [GraphEdge]      # sequence | branch | exception | loop_body
```

Nodes = steps. Edges = sequence, with typed room for branches / loops /
exception paths. Annotations = verification points and halt points. A linear
bundle (today's common case) projects to a straight chain of `action` nodes
ending in a `success` terminal; a Phase-2 program graph projects its full state
machine 1:1, so richer compiled structure renders without a spec break.

## CLI

```bash
# self-contained HTML (opens offline; no network, CSP-safe)
openadapt-flow visualize path/to/bundle -o program.html

# Mermaid flowchart source for Markdown / docs / a PR description
openadapt-flow visualize path/to/bundle --format mermaid

# the shared JSON graph spec (what Cloud and Desktop render)
openadapt-flow visualize path/to/bundle --format json -o program-graph.json

# a closed projection for a remote viewer or approved derivative
openadapt-flow visualize path/to/bundle --profile remote-safe -o program.html
```

The default `operator-local` profile includes local diagnostic detail.
`remote-safe`, `public-synthetic`, and `sanitized-derivative` remove recorded
text, parameter values, selectors, URLs, free-text predicates, and local
provenance. The projection does not sanitize the source bundle. It does not
prove that the source is safe to send.

## Rendering choice and tradeoffs

- **The engine emits the spec and each surface renders it.** Each surface avoids
  re-parsing the bundle IR. This keeps one projection of the compiled semantics
  and a single wire contract. Cloud and Desktop do not need to invent the graph
  from display order.
- **A small deterministic layout handles the offline view.** It follows the
  actual edge targets and draws back edges explicitly. It keeps the file
  self-contained and avoids a runtime dependency. Cloud uses a React renderer
  over the same graph contract. Mermaid remains a portable export format.
- **Self-contained HTML.** The CLI inlines the shared CSS + a dependency-free
  vanilla-JS renderer (`openadapt_flow/visualize/static/program_graph.{css,js}`)
  and embeds the spec as JSON, so the page opens offline and renders under a
  strict CSP.

## What `visualize` shows

This Mermaid output comes from the bounded loop fixture. The command uses the
public-safe projection, so it keeps the structure and removes recorded values.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  n0{"Repeat the bounded steps"}
  n1("Enter an approved input")
  n2("Enter an approved input")
  n3("Send an approved key<br/><small>effect · irreversible</small>")
  n4{{"End of declared steps"}}
  n0 -->|declared loop| n1
  n1 --> n2
  n2 --> n3
  n3 --> n0
  n0 --> n4
  classDef irreversible stroke:#b4530a,stroke-width:2px;
  classDef halt stroke:#b21f2d,stroke-width:2px;
  class n3 irreversible;
  class n3 halt;
```

How to read this map:

- `n0` owns the bounded loop. The `declared loop` edge enters its body.
- The edge from `n3` to `n0` returns for the next item. The edge from `n0` to
  `n4` exits when the worklist is complete.
- `End of declared steps` is a program terminal. It does not claim that a live
  run achieved `VERIFIED`.
- The HTML view adds the resolution, identity, screen, effect, and stop
  controls for each selected node.
