# Desktop Spike — Phase 1: WindowsBackend + Recording-Adapter Contract

Phase 1 de-risks the desktop integration (spec §2.1–§2.2). It does **not**
run the benchmark matrix — that is Phase 2, gated on the identity matcher
settling (PRs #16/#17). No model calls, no agent arm, $0 API spend.

## Infrastructure path taken: contract mock, not the live VM

The spec assumes the Azure WAA pool VM. Reality check at execution time:
`az vm list` returned **zero VMs across all enabled subscriptions** — the
`waa-pool-XX` pool does not currently exist, and bringing one up means
`pool-create` plus a ~20–35 minute Windows install (plus VM spend). Per the
phase plan, the WindowsBackend was therefore built and validated against a
**local stateful mock of the WAA HTTP contract**; the real-VM smoke test is
deferred to Phase 2 as a small wiring step.

The contract itself is taken from the authoritative client in
openadapt-evals (`openadapt_evals/training/standalone/waa_direct.py`,
the WAADirect pattern — plain HTTP, no adapter layer; the WAALiveAdapter is
known to crash the server):

| Endpoint | Contract |
|---|---|
| `GET /screenshot` | raw PNG bytes via Flask `send_file()` — **not** base64 JSON; read `resp.content` |
| `POST /execute_windows` | `{"command": "<bare Python statements>"}`; the server runs `exec(command, ...)` with `pyautogui` importable |

**Correction to project memory:** the note "WAA `/execute` needs a
`python -c "..."` wrapper" applies to a *different* endpoint. For
`/execute_windows` the WAADirect docstring is explicit: send bare Python
statements, do **not** wrap in `python -c`. This backend follows WAADirect
(and its tests `exec()` every emitted command to prove it is valid bare
Python).

## WindowsBackend (`openadapt_flow/backends/windows_backend.py`)

Implements the existing 4-method vision-only `Backend` protocol
(screenshot / click / type_text / press, + scroll) over the WAA HTTP API,
mirroring `PlaywrightBackend`'s shape. ~180 LOC. Design points:

- **Vision-only, honestly.** It does *not* implement the optional
  `StructuralBackend` observations (url / page_title / page_count): native
  Windows has no cheap equivalent, so steps that would rely on structural
  postconditions stay unverified (docs/LIMITS.md), exactly as the protocol
  intends. The replayer probes these with `getattr(..., None)` — absence is
  handled, not an error.
- **Viewport** is derived once from the first screenshot's PNG header
  (IHDR), overridable in the constructor. No resolution assumption.
- **Command safety.** Typed text is embedded via `repr()` — a valid Python
  literal, immune to quote/backslash injection (WAADirect's manual escaping
  is a known sharp edge).
- **Non-ASCII typing.** `pyautogui.write` silently drops characters it
  cannot type — a *silent wrong-write* mode. Non-ASCII text is therefore
  routed through the clipboard: base64 → PowerShell `Set-Clipboard` →
  Ctrl+V. ASCII text uses plain `pyautogui.write`.
- **Keys.** Playwright-style names/chords (what recordings and the replayer
  emit, e.g. `Enter`, `ControlOrMeta+a`, `Meta+d`) are normalized to
  pyautogui names (`enter`, `hotkey('ctrl','a')`, `hotkey('win','d')`);
  `ControlOrMeta` resolves to Ctrl on Windows.
- **Scroll.** The protocol speaks pixels (Playwright wheel, +dy = view
  down); pyautogui speaks wheel notches with the opposite vertical sign.
  Conversion is 100 px/notch (approximate by design — replay's closed-loop
  scroll re-resolves after every gesture, so the ratio is not load-bearing;
  tune on the real VM in Phase 2).
- **Screenshots** retry (server momentarily unready), and payloads are
  validated as PNG before being returned.
- `requests` is the only new dependency, behind the `windows` extra
  (`pip install 'openadapt-flow[windows]'`); the `backends` package
  re-exports lazily so nothing changes for browser-only users.

### Protocol conformance result: zero compiler/replayer changes

`tests/test_windows_backend.py::test_record_compile_replay_over_windows_backend`
runs the **unmodified** Recorder → compiler → Replayer stack over the
WindowsBackend against a stateful mock WAA app (a cv2-drawn 3-step
click → type-note → Enter workflow whose screen state advances only when
the emitted commands are correct, coordinate-checked): recording, bundle
compilation, and a successful replay (`report.success`, postconditions
verified by real OCR, typed-input verification passing) all work with no
changes to any existing module. The 4-method protocol held.

No abstraction leaks found in Phase 1. Two soft spots to watch on the real
VM (not leaks, tuning): screenshot latency vs. the settle-detection
polling budget, and the px/notch scroll ratio.

## Recording-adapter contract (`openadapt_flow/adapters/capture.py`)

The spike's main integration risk (spec §2.2): desktop demonstrations come
from **openadapt-capture**, whose output format was reverse-engineered from
the sibling repo (`openadapt_capture/events.py`, `storage`), and converted
to the flow recording format the compiler consumes.

### Input schema (openadapt-capture session directory)

```
<capture>/
  capture.db   # SQLite
  video.mp4    # screen video; frame wall-clock time =
               #   capture.video_start_time + frame_pts_seconds
```

`capture.db` tables (relevant columns):

- `capture(id, started_at, ended_at, platform, screen_width, screen_height,
  pixel_ratio, video_start_time, task_description, ...)` — one row.
- `events(timestamp REAL, type TEXT, data JSON, parent_id)` — raw streams
  (`mouse.move/down/up`, `key.down/up`, `screen.frame`, `audio.chunk`) plus
  *derived* action events produced by openadapt-capture's post-processing
  (`process_events`): `mouse.singleclick`, `mouse.doubleclick`,
  `mouse.drag`, `key.type`, `mouse.scroll`.

### Output schema (openadapt-flow recording, unchanged)

```
<recording>/
  meta.json      # {"id", "created_at", "viewport": [w,h], "app_url": null,
                 #  "params": {...}, "source": "openadapt-capture",
                 #  "task_description": ...}
  events.jsonl   # {"i":0,"kind":"click","x":..,"y":..,"t":..} etc.
  frames/{i:04d}_before.png / _after.png
```

### Conversion rules

| capture event | flow event | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mouse.singleclick` (left) | `{"kind":"click"}` | non-left buttons: **rejected** (no flow equivalent) |
| `mouse.doubleclick` (left) | `{"kind":"double_click"}` | |
| `key.type {text}` | `{"kind":"type","text",...}` | marked `"param"` when the text equals a value in the caller's `params` map |
| `key.down` (named, non-modifier) | `{"kind":"key","key"}` | pynput names mapped to Playwright names (`enter`→`Enter`, `esc`→`Escape`, `up`→`ArrowUp`, ...); bare modifier presses skipped |
| `mouse.scroll {dx,dy}` | `{"kind":"scroll"}` | pynput notches (+dy = scroll up) → pixels at 100 px/notch with vertical sign flipped (+dy = view down); signs provisional until verified on hardware |
| `mouse.move`, `mouse.down/up`, `key.up`, `screen.frame`, `audio.chunk` | skipped | already merged into derived events / irrelevant to replay |

**Loud-failure rules** (silent drops are wrong-action seeds):

- Raw-only sessions (no derived events) → `ValueError`: run
  openadapt-capture's `process_events` first; deriving actions is the
  capture library's job, not the adapter's.
- `mouse.drag`, `key.shortcut`, and any *unknown* `mouse.*`/`key.*` type →
  `ValueError` (converting would silently drop a user action).
- Unmapped named keys → `ValueError` naming the key.
- Two params demonstrating the same value → `ValueError` (ambiguous
  marking).

**Coordinate spaces.** Capture mouse coordinates are logical points
(pynput); video frames are physical pixels (Retina/HiDPI differ by
`pixel_ratio`). Flow requires event coordinates in frame-pixel space, so
points are scaled by `video_frame_width / capture.screen_width` — the video
is authoritative, not the stored ratio.

**Frame selection.** For an event at wall-clock `T`: *before* = last video
frame at/before `T`; *after* = frame at `T + settle_s` (default 1.0 s),
clamped to just before the next event. This approximates the live
Recorder's perceptual-hash settle wait offline; if it proves too coarse on
real captures, the fix is a phash-based settle scan over the video segment
— same module, no format change.

### Contract validation

`tests/test_capture_adapter.py` builds a synthetic capture session — a real
SQLite `capture.db` in openadapt-capture's exact schema and a real
`video.mp4` (cv2-encoded, Retina-style 2× pixel ratio) — converts it, and
asserts: event mapping/order, recorder line-format parity, coordinate
scaling, before/after frame selection (classified against the app's state
ladder), param marking, and every loud-failure rule. The converted
recording is then compiled by the **unmodified** `compile_recording`
(click/type/key steps, param preserved). The format bridge is proven.

## Proven vs deferred

Proven in Phase 1 (all offline, mock-contract):

- WindowsBackend implements the Backend protocol; commands match the WAA
  wire format (every emitted command is `exec()`'d in tests the way the
  server does it).
- Zero compiler/replayer changes needed — full record→compile→replay loop
  over the WindowsBackend succeeds.
- capture→flow recording contract defined, implemented, and compiler-
  accepted on a synthetic demonstration.

Deferred to Phase 2 (needs VM / matcher settled):

1. Bring up a WAA pool VM (`oa-vm pool-create` → `pool-wait`; never
   `az vm restart`) and run the real 2–3-step smoke (Notepad-class app)
   through the WindowsBackend: screenshot latency vs settle budget, scroll
   px/notch, pyautogui key-name coverage, clipboard-paste path on real
   PowerShell. (Note: the local `oa-vm` CLI itself is currently broken by a
   NumPy 2 incompatibility in openadapt-evals' import chain — fix or use
   raw `az` + SSH tunnel.)
2. Convert a *real* openadapt-capture recording (incl. `process_events`
   derivation, real video timing) — the synthetic test pins the schema, not
   capture's runtime quirks.
3. OpenDental install + DB ground truth, drift matrix, identity/false-abort
   numbers on desktop rendering, UIA steelman arm, Mode B (RDP stream) —
   the benchmark proper (spec §3–§7), after PRs #16/#17 land.
