# Adversarial validation — failure-mode matrix

Date: 2026-07-08 (initial audit and same-day fix); updated 2026-07-09
(postcondition-mining fix + live re-run); updated 2026-07-10 (identity
matcher rebuilt after the THIRD wrong-patient reopening — near-name
siblings — with a frozen held-out adversarial corpus and a published
ROC; see the 2026-07-10 fix update). This document is the
result of deliberately trying to break compiled replay before anyone else
does. Every experiment ran with **zero model calls and $0 of API spend**:
compiled-replay only, no grounder, no agent arm. Failures found here are
the point of the exercise; nothing is softened.

## Fix update (2026-07-08, `feat/fix-wrong-actions`)

The initial audit found **6 wrong-actions (5 silent)** across two root
causes. Both are now fixed; the tables below carry **before → after**
columns and the characterization tests pin the new behavior.

1. **Identity-blind target resolution** → **pre-click identity check**
   (`openadapt_flow/runtime/identity.py`). The compiler now records each
   click target's *context band* — the OCR text of the click point's own
   text row, excluding the target's own crop (labels stay mutable/
   healable) and timestamp-bearing lines (volatile); bands shorter than
   12 squashed characters are too generic to discriminate and are not
   recorded. Before every click (including an anchored TYPE step's
   focusing click) the replayer re-reads the resolved point's own row and
   matches it token-wise, order-insensitively (OCR re-reads the same band
   in different segmentation orders between visits): matched tokens must
   cover >= 0.8 of the recorded band AND no contiguous run of uncovered
   recorded characters may exceed 4 — a wrong entity is a contiguous
   mismatch (a replaced name), so long shared row text cannot buy it a
   pass. Measured: true row 1.0 (still 1.0 under injected per-character
   OCR jitter, via a 0.7 whole-token similarity tier — REMOVED
   2026-07-10: that tier verified near-name siblings, the third
   wrong-patient reopening; see that fix update below); look-alike row
   sharing all non-name columns ~0.67 coverage with a 10-char uncovered
   name run. When a workflow parameter's demonstrated value is embedded
   in the recorded band (a parameterized *target*, e.g. the patient row),
   the run's value is substituted into the recorded band and the WHOLE
   substituted band must match — a row that merely mentions the run's
   value does not verify. On mismatch: safe-halt *before* the click, with
   the expected and observed band text in the error. On an unreadable
   band (OCR found nothing, retried at 2x resolution first): reversible
   steps proceed with the step flagged (`StepResult.identity.status ==
   "unreadable"`); steps marked irreversible at compile time refuse (risk
   is opt-in via `compile_recording(risk_overrides=...)` — never
   auto-assigned; see docs/LIMITS.md for what that means by default).
   This is a pre-action check against runtime values — the commit-8421d51
   rule (never bake a parameterized value's rendering into compiled
   *postconditions*) still holds untouched.
2. **Unverified typed input** → **typed-input verification**
   (`Replayer._verify_typed_input`). After every TYPE action, an OCR-able
   typed value must be READ back from the field region (around the
   focusing click; whole frame when focus was moved by keyboard;
   2x-resolution retry). A pixel change alone is accepted only when the
   region gained no other readable text — the masked-field (password
   dots) shape — so a dialog rendering over the field cannot
   false-verify while keystrokes fell elsewhere. When nothing changed at
   all: ONE refocus-and-retype retry (re-click the field, select-all so a
   false-negative first attempt is replaced rather than duplicated,
   retype), then safe-halt. When the region changed but the value is
   unreadable: immediate safe-halt WITHOUT retyping (retyping into an
   unknown render state could destroy pre-existing field content). The
   typed value is verified at *runtime*; nothing is baked into the
   bundle.

The identity matcher and typed-input verifier above describe their
**2026-07-09 hardened form** (adversarial review of the initial fix):
the initial char-coverage matcher verified a wrong entity when shared
row text dominated the band (coverage 0.89), verified generic bands
("Active High 3" vs "Active High 7" at 0.91), let ANY short embedded
param value disarm the band check entirely (wrong patient at 1.0 with
`priority="High"`), verified any row containing the run's value, spanned
2-3 table rows (one-row-off text bleed), and its order-sensitive scoring
false-aborted a correct OpenEMR modal target at 0.66 when page chrome
re-read in a different order. All six are pinned in
`tests/test_identity.py` / `tests/test_replayer.py`.

**After the fix: 0 wrong-actions across every case the suites pin** — the
six audit reproductions (tables below), the six review probes above, and
the perturbation/chaos/primitive matrices. Every previously-silent case
now ends in a safe-halt before the wrong action, or (steal-focus)
recovers and completes correctly. The claim is scoped to exactly those
pinned cases: the dangerous list in docs/LIMITS.md (zero-postcondition
steps, label-only and too-generic-band targets, unreadable bands on
default-compiled — reversible — steps) remains open and is NOT covered
by it. Residual gaps are listed honestly under "Failure modes ranked by
severity".

**False-abort cost of the fix: none measured** (initial fix; the
2026-07-09 hardening additionally FIXED a measured false abort — the
OpenEMR modal-band order-sensitivity above).

**Live false-abort re-check of the hardened thresholds (2026-07-09,
OpenEMR public demo, fake patients, $0, 0 model calls; public-demo
courtesy: 4 sessions total — 1 fresh record+compile, 3 paced replays).**
The fresh bundle armed **4 of 12** click steps with (row-refined)
identity context. Across 3 replays: **6/6 identity evaluations verified
at coverage 1.0** (the top-menu band and the patient-search-result row) —
**zero identity false-aborts from the tightened thresholds** — and **9/9
typed inputs verified** (username, masked password, parameterized note),
zero retries. All 3 replays then safe-halted at the SAME pre-existing,
identity-unrelated point: the Messages-card pencil click (step_013, an
UNARMED step — a tiny generic icon anchor with no row text). The
closed-loop scroll's anchor probe accepted a look-alike pencil above the
fold (the dashboard has one per card), the dashboard never scrolled, the
geometry click missed, and the step's postconditions caught it — an
honest halt in the documented P2 anchor/instance-state class (that day's
post-reset dashboard content differed from the 2026-07-08 regression,
where the same flow reached the note dialog 3/3). Nothing was written on
any run.

- MockMed local benchmark, compiled arm end-to-end (fresh recording,
  arm-independent OCR verification of the final screen): **30/30 clean
  replays** and **3/3 `drift=theme` replays** (all heals + context
  refreshes verified), mean 6.8 s per clean run, 0 model calls.
- The full e2e matrix (baseline x3, params, viewports, theme/move/rename
  healing incl. healed-bundle re-replay, slow renders, CLI smoke) stayed
  green — the identity gate and typed-input verification changed no
  happy-path outcome.
- OpenEMR live regression (public demo, fake patients, 1 fresh recording +
  3 replays paced >= 35 s, $0; measured with the INITIAL matcher): the
  fresh bundle armed **7 of 12** click steps with identity context (the
  rest have no out-of-crop row text — login button, patient-chart link,
  pencil icon). Across 3 replays, **all 18 identity evaluations verified**
  at coverage 0.95–1.00 on real dense EMR rows (patient-result row, menu
  bar, dialog chrome) — **zero identity false-aborts** — and **9/9 typed
  inputs verified** (username, masked password, parameterized note) with
  zero retries needed. (Separately, live runs by the postcondition-mining
  work later reproduced an identity FALSE ABORT on the note-dialog
  textarea band under the initial ORDER-SENSITIVE matcher — 2/2 control
  replays, score ~0.66 — which the 2026-07-09 order-insensitive matcher
  fixes; that band shape is pinned in `tests/test_identity.py`.) All 3
  replays later aborted at the note-dialog step on a PRE-EXISTING, already
  documented defect: the mined `text_present ':01'` postcondition (the
  Track D "stray `:01` that slipped past the timestamp filter" —
  postcondition mining fragility, P2 below, deliberately out of scope of
  this fix — **fixed in the 2026-07-09 update that follows**). Same-day
  record→replay was enough for that timestamp fragment to leave the
  screen. The identity/typed-input layers behaved exactly as intended
  before the unrelated halt.

## Fix update (2026-07-09, `feat/fix-postcondition-mining`)

The audit's P2 "assertions overfit" and P3 "vacuous successes" findings —
and the `text_present ':01'` false-halt that aborted all three 2026-07-08
OpenEMR regression replays — are addressed by making postcondition mining
**select for stability, not novelty**:

1. **Volatility classifier** (`openadapt_flow/volatility.py`, shared by the
   compiler and the identity-context extractor). TEXT_PRESENT candidates,
   geometry landmarks and identity-band lines are rejected when they carry
   a clock time (including bare `':01'`-class OCR fragments, which slipped
   past the old pattern), a date NEAR the recording date (content
   chronology: log rows, "last updated" chrome), digit/punctuation-dominated
   text (counters, badges) or low-entropy noise. A date FAR from the
   recording date — a DOB in a patient banner — is deliberately **kept**:
   the old blanket timestamp filter ate identity banners because a DOB
   looks like a date, which is exactly the mechanism that left the MockMed
   wrong-patient rows without an identity-bearing assertion.
2. **Empirical stability check.** A candidate that appears in a step's
   after frame but is gone (or changed) by the NEXT step's before frame —
   two captures of the same screen, moments apart — is volatile by
   demonstration (toasts, spinners, ticking counters) and never asserted.
   The same rule drops REGION_STABLE postconditions whose region
   self-mutates between the two captures.
3. **Ranking prefers semantics over length.** "Longest new text" is gone;
   surviving candidates are ranked by alphabetic content with a proximity
   tiebreak toward the click target (text near the action is likelier to
   describe its effect than a distant data row).
4. **Structural fallback postconditions.** Steps that mined nothing visual
   (identical before/after frames — a new-tab click, an off-screen SPA
   route change) now assert URL_CHANGED / TITLE_CHANGED / NEW_TAB_OPENED
   when the recorder captured the backend's structural observations
   (Playwright exposes URL / title / page count). Nothing instance-specific
   is baked in — the replayer compares the step's END state to its own
   START state. Steps with no structural change either stay honestly
   vacuous, and on a backend that cannot observe the property the
   postcondition passes honestly-unverified rather than false-halting.
5. **Parameter hygiene.** Demo parameter values are excluded from geometry
   landmarks (on OpenEMR the save step's landmark used to be the recorded
   note text itself), and a compile-time lint fails compilation loudly if a
   demonstrated parameter value appears in any **text** postcondition or
   any landmark's OCR text outside the designated slots (`workflow.params`,
   a parameterized TYPE step's recorded example, anchor resolution/identity
   evidence — which re-anchors on the run's value at replay). Scoped
   precisely: the lint reads text evidence only. A later step's
   REGION_STABLE template can still embed the demo value's rendered
   *pixels*; that is a false-halt-direction gap (safe, costs availability),
   listed under known remaining.

Concrete before → after, same recordings:

- MockMed chart-open step: before `text_present 'No encounters yet.'`
  (patient-agnostic — the DOB banner was eaten by the timestamp filter);
  after `text_present 'JaneSample—MRNP1—DOB1980-01-01'` (the identity
  banner, DOB included).
- OpenEMR fresh bundle (2026-07-09, live demo): every mined TEXT_PRESENT
  is chrome or card/table headers — the main menu bar, `Treatment
  Intervention Preferences`, `Last update` (the column header, where the
  old miner grabbed a message row's timestamp), `Showing 1 to 1 of 1
  entries…`. No timestamps, no `':01'` fragments, no note text, no other
  patients' rows. Per-step list below under Track D.
- Verification: full unit + e2e matrix green (387 tests after the review
  hardening below and the merge with the `feat/fix-wrong-actions` review
  hardening, including the perturbation/chaos/primitives characterization
  suites, re-run whole); OpenEMR live check under Track D below
  (2026-07-09 re-run).

**False-abort cost of this fix: none measured** — the MockMed baseline,
params, viewport, healing and slow-render scenarios all stayed green, and
the theme-drift heal showcase is unaffected.

**Exposed by this fix (pre-existing, disclosed):** with the `':01'` halt
gone, the live OpenEMR control replays now run 2 steps further and hit a
reproducible **identity-layer false abort** at the note-dialog textarea
click (step_014, 2/2 control replays): the recorded context band
(`'PPV + Show All <Back to Patient ShowActive'` — background chrome read
*through* a modal dialog, including an OCR-garbage token) never reproduces
under live OCR segmentation (`'+Add BacktoPatient Show All ShowActive'` —
same tokens, different segmentation/order), and the in-order coverage
matcher scores it ~0.66 < 0.8. Zero wrong actions — the halt is safe — but
it caps the control run at 14/17. This is the `feat/fix-wrong-actions`
identity band's matcher (order-sensitive `difflib` block coverage), not
postcondition mining; it was previously unmeasurable because every replay
aborted earlier on `':01'`. It was left un-touched by the mining fix
deliberately (the coverage semantics carried measured safety margins —
look-alike row = 0.70, threshold 0.8 — that an order-insensitive rewrite
would need to re-validate). **RESOLVED 2026-07-09**: the
`feat/fix-wrong-actions` review hardening did exactly that rewrite —
token-wise order-insensitive matching with a re-validated look-alike
margin (~0.67 coverage plus a 10-char uncovered run vs. the 0.8 AND
<=4-run thresholds) — and the permuted modal-band shape above is pinned
verified at 1.0 in `tests/test_identity.py`.

### Review hardening (2026-07-09, same branch)

Review of this fix produced verified classifier evasions — all fixed, all
pinned as unit tests in both directions (`tests/test_volatility.py`):

- **Month-name dates** classified as stable: `Jul 8, 2026`, `08 Jul 2026`,
  `Updated Jul 8`, `July 2026`, `Wednesday July 8` all evaded the
  numeric-only date pattern. Concrete risk: OpenEMR's post-login screen is
  a calendar — a mined `July 2026` header false-halts every replay the
  next month. Month-name fragments now feed the same near/far split as
  numeric dates; a month-day with no year (`Updated Jul 8`) recurs
  annually and is always volatile; a month-name DOB (`Jan 1, 1980`) is
  kept as identity data, exactly like the numeric form.
- **Relative-time phrases**: `3 min ago`, `2 hours ago`, `just now`, and a
  standalone `Yesterday`/`Today`/`Tomorrow` (message-list group headers)
  are volatile; embedded day-words in stable chrome ("Today's
  Appointments") are kept.
- **Counts and pagination**: `56 total entries`, `1 to 1 of 1`,
  `5 new messages` — and `Page 2 of 9`, previously pinned as *stable* by a
  unit test, reclassified: pagination position is navigation state that
  changes with data volume on shared instances, not identity.
- **Badge counters**: `Inbox (2)`, `Messages (14)` — a parenthesized bare
  integer is a live counter decorating an otherwise-stable label
  (strip-and-test: if removing it leaves the classification unchanged, the
  composite is rejected; the label alone remains minable).
- **European dot-clocks**: `Last updated 18.38`. Only unambiguous forms
  count (two-digit hour in valid range, an am/pm suffix, or a time-context
  word) so version/section numbers survive: `v2.0`, `v2.10 changelog` and
  `Version 2.10 release notes` are pinned stable.
- **Heal-time band refresh dropped DOB lines**: `_recontext` passed no
  reference date, so every date-bearing line was conservatively dropped
  from a healed anchor's refreshed band — including the DOB, the band's
  most discriminative identity evidence. It now anchors the near/far split
  on the heal date (`date.today()`), the exact analogue of the recording
  date at compile time.

The `Showing 1 to 1 of 1 entries (filtered from 56 total entries)` banner
the 2026-07-09 fresh bundle mined (step_007 below) is a case study in why
counts had to go: reviewer-measured, the per-line fuzzy matcher (0.8)
scores `0 to 0 of 0 entries` at **0.95** against it — the exact
empty-result state the assertion should catch PASSES — while a missing
`(filtered from …)` suffix scores 0.62 and false-halts. **Fuzzy matching
on digit-differing lines is a known remaining weakness: a one-digit count
difference scores above the 0.8 threshold**, beneath the matcher's
resolution. The fix here is upstream, not a matcher redesign: that banner
now classifies as `count` (pinned by test, spaced and OCR-squashed forms
both) and can never become an assertion.

Known remaining, documented here deliberately (not attempted):

- **Long-line anchors are OCR-segmentation-fragile at the resolution
  rung**: `find_text` fuzzy-matches whole OCR lines with no multi-line
  joining, so a long anchor `ocr_text` the engine re-segments differently
  can miss the OCR rung and degrade resolution to geometry. (The
  *assertion* side of this mechanism was fixed by `feat/fix-wrong-actions`:
  TEXT_PRESENT/ABSENT checks go through the segmentation-tolerant
  `vision.text_present` — whole-line ratio OR a contiguous >=0.8-of-target
  run across concatenated lines, merged/split re-reads exercised against
  the real engine in `tests/test_vision.py`.)
- **Structural checks pass as honestly-unverified on a transient None**
  (URL/title/page-count read None on either side), even on backends that
  are normally structural.
- **NEW_TAB_OPENED false-halts on named-window reuse**: re-targeting an
  existing named window navigates it without increasing the page count.
- **The persistence check has no coverage on the recording's final step**
  (no next before-frame exists): a final-step toast can still be asserted.
- **REGION_STABLE templates can embed rendered parameter pixels** (see the
  lint scope note above) — false-halt direction only.

## Fix update (2026-07-10, `feat/identity-roc`): the THIRD wrong-patient reopening

Said plainly: the wrong-patient P0 reopened a **third** time. History:
pixel-lookalike rows (fixed 2026-07-08 by the context bands) → residue-
blind coverage + short-param disarm (fixed 2026-07-09 by the token
matcher + residue cap) → **near-name siblings** (this fix). The
2026-07-09 matcher returned `(coverage=1.0, residue=0)` — VERIFIED — for
all four of these reproduced probes:

- recorded `Belford, Phil 1985-03-12 M` vs observed
  `Belford, Philip 1985-03-12 M` (containment tier: 'Phil' ⊂ 'Philip');
- the reverse direction (similarity tier: ratio 0.8);
- `Smith, John 1985-03-12 M` vs `Smith, Joan 1985-03-12 M` (similarity
  tier: SequenceMatcher('John','Joan') = 0.75 >= 0.7);
- `Belford, Phil ...` vs `Belford, Phillipa ...` (containment tier).

Real EMR rows are full of near-name siblings — family members sharing a
surname, Jr/Sr, John/Joan — and downstream note verification does NOT
catch a wrong-patient write: the note really is saved, in the wrong
chart. All four probes are pinned as permanent mismatches in
`tests/test_identity.py`.

**Methodology change — held-out corpus BEFORE the fix.** The recurring
failure mode of this document is fixing against exactly the adversaries
that found the last bug (a fixed point, not a false-negative rate). This
fix broke the cycle: a deterministic, seeded adversarial corpus
(`openadapt_flow/validation/adversary_corpus.py`, seed 20260710, 4360
pairs — 2200 `different_entity` across 10 generator categories, 2160
`same_entity` OCR-noise pairs across 9) was generated and **frozen
first** — its sha256 manifest is committed
(`adversary_corpus_manifest.json`) and pinned by tests, so post-hoc
tuning of the corpus toward the matcher is detectable in git history —
and only then was the matcher evaluated and rebuilt. No generator bugs
were found or fixed after first evaluation (the generator is byte-
identical to the pre-evaluation commit).

**Measured, before → after** (full tables and the ROC chart:
[IDENTITY_ROC.md](IDENTITY_ROC.md), `identity_roc.png`):

| corpus category (`different_entity`) | old matcher false-accept | new |
|---|---|---|
| DOB off by one field | 99.1% | 0.0% |
| generational suffix (Jr/Sr/II) | 99.1% | 0.0% |
| single-letter edit (John/Joan) | 98.2% | 0.0% |
| transposition | 95.5% | 0.0% |
| prefix extension (Phil/Philip) | 72.3% | 0.0% |
| MRN digit swap | 50.0% | 0.0% |
| same surname, different first | 15.5% | 0.0% |
| **overall (2200 pairs)** | **53.9%** | **0.0%** |

(Scope caveat, added 2026-07-10: this 0.0% is on corpus v1 ONLY, and the
out-of-corpus review later the same day showed it was partially
tautological — v1's labeling rule excludes confusion-collided names,
short-token discriminators, observed supersets and absent-name shapes
by construction, and 13 probes in those classes all VERIFIED against
this exact matcher. See the out-of-corpus fix update below.)

False aborts on the `same_entity` side: 12.1% → 10.7% (i.e. the fix also
*reduced* the availability cost slightly; the remainder is ~90%
concentrated in the occlusion category — ~~bands whose identity tokens
were never read, where refusing is the correct epistemic outcome~~
**CORRECTED by the 2026-07-10 out-of-corpus review's recount**: 102 of
the 216 occlusion aborts at this operating point still had BOTH name
tokens readable and aborted on trailing DOB/MRN loss. Roughly half the
occlusion refusals were a plain availability cost on rows whose name
WAS readable — a priced trade-off, not the epistemic virtue this
paragraph originally claimed; see the out-of-corpus fix update below).

**The rebuild** (`runtime/identity.py`): token matching accepts ONLY
OCR-equivalence — identity under the character-confusion classes real
engines produce (l/1/i, O/0, 5/s, 2/z, 8/b, 9/g, rn/m, cl/d, vv/w) —
plus full-consumption token splits/joins; the containment and raw-
similarity tiers are gone. Unmatched tokens are split into *absence*
(uncovered runs, budgeted as before — OCR dropout, the cheap direction)
and *contradiction* (near-miss similarity >= 0.62 on canonical forms,
semantic containment with alphabetic residue, replacement by an
unexplained observed token, generational suffix on one side), which has
its own budget of ZERO characters. The modal-band permutation class, OCR
jitter, splits/joins and the MockMed/OpenEMR true-row shapes all still
verify (pinned).

**Operating point, chosen from the ROC with the weighting said out
loud** (a wrong-patient write is catastrophic; a false abort is a ~$0.10
hybrid fallback — we price that at 4+ orders of magnitude): coverage
0.8, uncovered-run cap 4, contradiction_sim 0.62, contradiction cap 0.
NOT the on-corpus Pareto-minimal false-abort corner (coverage 0.7 / run
cap 8, FAbort 7.96%): that corner's zero false accepts rests entirely on
the contradiction rule (evade it and FA is 60.8%), while at 0.8/4 the
older coverage/run budgets independently stop 79.5% of the corpus even
with contradiction disabled — defense in depth bought with 2.7pp of
false aborts concentrated in occlusion shapes (~~unreadable-name~~ see
the recount correction above: about half of those bands still had
readable names). Regression nets: the operating point is pinned by
boundary tests, and a corpus-wide test asserts **zero** false accepts
(a rate, not a probe list) plus a false-abort budget. (Both the zero
and the budget were superseded the same day — see the out-of-corpus
fix update below.)

**Protection coverage became a first-class metric in the same change**
(it was previously a buried sentence in a live-check note): the live
2026-07-09 OpenEMR check armed only **4 of 12** click steps — every
identity guarantee above applies to armed steps ONLY, and an unarmed
click proceeds with no identity check at all. Now: `workflow.json`
carries per-step `identity_armed` / `identity_unarmed_reason` (bundle
auditable before running), every REPORT.md states "N of M click steps
identity-armed" and lists unarmed steps by id with the compile-time
reason, benchmark BENCHMARK.md methodology sections carry the metric
(historical results.json files lack the per-run data; the generators now
record it and the committed files note that), and docs/LIMITS.md leads
the dangerous list with it.

## Fix update (2026-07-10, out-of-corpus review): the corpus-v1 zero was partially tautological

Said plainly: the wrong-patient P0 reopened a **fourth** time, hours
after the third fix — and this time the frozen corpus itself was part of
the failure. The review verified **13 probes against the shipped matcher
at the shipped operating point; all 13 silently VERIFIED**, and every
one belongs to a class corpus v1 excluded BY CONSTRUCTION (its labeling
rule treats confusion-equivalent bands as same-entity and rejects them
as "mislabeled"; short-token, observed-superset and absent-name shapes
were never generated). The probes are pinned verbatim in
`tests/test_identity_out_of_corpus.py`, committed FIRST (failing) as the
acceptance criteria:

- **Blocker 1 — canonicalization equates distinct names.** 'Smith,
  Neil' vs 'Smith, Nell' (i/l), 'Clay, Susan' vs 'Day, Susan' (cl/d),
  'Baker, Marnie' vs 'Baker, Mamie' (rn/m), 'Gail Turner' vs 'Gall
  Turner' (i/l): different real patients whose names canonicalize
  identically all verified at coverage 1.0. Param mode was NOT
  vulnerable — its raw `longest_run` check rejects Neil→Nell — i.e. the
  stricter raw pattern already existed in the codebase.
- **Blocker 2 — sub-MIN_BLOCK tokens invisible to contradiction.** A
  changed middle initial ('John J' vs 'John K'), the SEX column ('M' vs
  'F'), and changed 2-char names ('Al'/'Bo', 'Jo'/'Ed') all verified.
- **Blocker 3 — observed-side supersets always verified.** Context mode
  had no unexplained-observed-token budget (param mode HAS one):
  appended middle names, a two-row OCR merge, and the realistic shape —
  a message/cc row that merely MENTIONS the recorded patient — all
  verified.
- **Major 4 — absent identity token at the run cap.** 'Belford, Phil'
  vs 'Belford,' verified with the 4-char first name never read; the
  shape was even PINNED AS CORRECT in the operating-point boundary test
  (that pin is now flipped).

**The redesign** (same file, `runtime/identity.py`): three new budgets
and one class weighting, all zero-tolerance at the operating point —
*suspect* characters (a name-plausible token matched only by a
LETTER-LETTER confusion: indistinguishable from a real sibling, so it
refuses; digit/symbol confusions stay clean matches because names
contain no digits), *unexplained observed name-shaped tokens*
(closes the superset hole; lowercase adjacent-row bleed stays exempt),
count-based *short-token replacement* contradiction (a replaced initial
that duplicates the sex column is caught by the multiset even when
per-pair matching looks "explained"), and an *absent name-like token*
cap (absence of a 4+ char alphabetic token refuses even inside the
generic run cap — trailing-numerics dropout keeps the old tolerance).
The replayer also now extracts the LIVE band exactly as the compiler
extracted the recorded band (target's own crop excluded, volatile lines
dropped against the replay date) — the earlier asymmetry is what made an
observed-superset budget impossible.

**Corpus v2** (frozen with its own seed and SHA manifest BEFORE the
matcher redesign was evaluated on it — same freeze discipline, and v1's
generator and manifest are untouched): 2240 pairs across the excluded
classes, including a third label, **indistinguishable** — the true row
misread by a letter-letter confusion, textually identical to a real
sibling. ABORT is the correct outcome for BOTH readings there: an abort
is a justified abort (never a false abort), a verify is a false accept
for the different-entity twin.

**Measured, at the re-picked operating point** (full tables, occlusion
recount and the realistic-exposure analysis: IDENTITY_ROC.md):

- false accepts: **0 across v1 (2200 wrong-entity pairs), v2 (1590
  wrong-entity + 200 indistinguishable), and the 13-probe set** — a
  claim scoped to those corpora, NOT to the world; the operating point
  is fit on the same corpora that produce the headline, and v1's own
  zero was shown tautological one review ago. The regression net
  (`tests/test_identity_corpus_rates.py`) asserts the zero on both
  corpora.
- false aborts: v1 **21.2%** (up from 10.7% — the availability bill of
  closing the four blockers, concentrated in occlusion 93%, compound
  noise 38%, letter-letter confusion noise 33%, capitalized adjacent
  bleed 26%), v2 legitimate-noise classes **0.0%**.
- indistinguishable class: **200/200 abort** (correct for both
  readings). The same mechanism prices v1's letter-letter
  `ocr_confusion` aborts: v1 labels them same-entity because its
  generator KNOWS it applied noise; the matcher cannot know that, and
  treating them as verifiable was exactly Blocker 1.
- occlusion recount: at the shipped decision, **102 of 216** occlusion
  aborts still had both name tokens readable (the abort was trailing
  DOB/MRN loss) — the earlier "identity tokens were never read"
  framing was wrong and is corrected above and in LIMITS.md.
- realistic exposure: the Blocker-1 probes used IDENTICAL MRNs on
  different patients (unrealistic — MRNs are unique). On realistic
  collided pairs with differing readable DOB/MRN, the absence/
  contradiction budgets alone catch 180/180 even with the suspect rule
  disabled; the TRUE residual-exposure shape is the band where the
  name is the ONLY discriminative token (180/180 caught, but by the
  suspect rule alone, which only covers collisions inside the frozen
  confusion table). Remaining verify classes, disclosed in LIMITS.md:
  'Ann Marie'/'Annmarie' token-join equivalence, case/whitespace-only
  name differences, 1-2 char letter-letter confusions (an 'I' vs 'L'
  initial), and an ADDED (not replaced) 1-2 char token.

## Outcome vocabulary

- **pass** — the run succeeded and did what the demonstration did.
- **safe-halt** — the run stopped with an accurate report and took no
  further actions. A *false abort* is a safe-halt whose cause was cosmetic
  (the task could have continued); it costs availability, not safety.
- **wrong-action** — the run executed an action on the wrong target or
  wrote incorrect state. *Silent* wrong-actions additionally reported
  success. **This is the critical class.**
- **crash** — an unhandled exception. (None occurred anywhere.)

## Headline numbers

Initial audit — **wrong-actions: 6**, of which **5 were silent** (wrong
state written AND the run reported success; 4 of the 5 silent modes
reproduced on every platform, while the `drift=grow` wrong-patient
outcome was observed on the recording platform and is
platform/rendering-dependent — see row 3). After the fix — **0**:

| # | case | before (audit) | after (fix) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `drift=lookalike` | **silent wrong-action** — saved to the look-alike patient | safe-halt before the click (identity coverage ~0.67 < 0.8, 10-char uncovered name run) |
| 2 | `drift=missing` | **silent wrong-action** — saved to the neighbouring patient | safe-halt before the click (coverage 0.00) |
| 3 | `drift=grow` | **silent wrong-action** — saved to the imposter at the recorded position | safe-halt before the click (coverage 0.00); on platforms where the global rung finds the true row first, a verified save to the CORRECT patient |
| 4 | chaos `delete-target-row` | **silent wrong-action** — saved to the patient that slid into place | safe-halt before the click (coverage 0.00) |
| 5 | chaos `steal-focus` | **silent wrong-action** — empty note saved, green report | **recovers**: refocus-and-retype retry lands the note; run completes with the CORRECT note (a failing retry safe-halts) |
| 6 | `sort-reorder` | wrong-action (caught) — wrong row clicked, state written, then halted | safe-halt before ANY click; app state untouched |

- **Safe-halt rate on the remaining perturbations/faults: 100%** — every
  non-silent failure halted with an accurate report; postconditions never
  produced a false success outside the wrong-action cases above; there were
  **zero crashes** across all tracks, before and after the fix.
- OpenEMR (live, public demo): 0 wrong-actions in 4 replays; the patient
  parameterization and cross-instance runs both ended in safe-halts whose
  mechanisms are findings in their own right (below).

All MockMed experiments are automated as characterization tests —
`tests/e2e/test_perturbation.py`, `tests/e2e/test_chaos.py`,
`tests/e2e/test_primitives.py` — so the failure modes are pinned: if one of
those tests ever fails, a documented failure mode changed (was fixed, or got
worse) and this document must be updated. OpenEMR experiments are driven by
`scripts/openemr_param_depth.py` (paced, fake patients only, not in CI).

Evidence pointers below refer to local, gitignored artifacts under
`runs/validation/` (full per-step screenshots, reports, healed bundles).
The pytest suites regenerate equivalent artifacts under their run dirs.

## Track A — perturbation/drift matrix (MockMed)

One recording (1280x800, default theme), replayed under one perturbation at
a time. Automated in `tests/e2e/test_perturbation.py`.

| perturbation | before → after | detail |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | pass | 8/8 anchors on the `template` rung, 0 heals |
| viewport 1440x900 | pass | layout is left-anchored; nothing moved |
| viewport 1024x768 | pass | same |
| viewport 900x360 (target below fold) | safe-halt (false abort) | halted at the note-field step: its REGION_STABLE region extends past the short viewport. The save button was off-screen and unreachable anyway — no scroll was demonstrated, and closed-loop scrolling only extends *recorded* scroll steps |
| device scale factor 2 | safe-halt (false abort) | halts at step_000: screenshots are 2x the coordinate space; template scale ladder tops out at 1.18x; OCR returns frame-pixel coordinates that no longer equal input pixels |
| CSS zoom 125% (`drift=zoom`) | safe-halt (false abort) | halts at step_000 for the same family of reasons |
| font size 16px→19px (`drift=font`) | safe-halt (false abort) | halts at step_000: REGION_STABLE phash cannot tolerate reflowed glyph metrics. Theme drift heals (README showcase); font drift yields 0% replayability |
| data growth (`drift=grow`, 4 rows added above target) | **wrong-action, silent → safe-halt** | before: local template matched the imposter row at the recorded position (≥0.985 despite different reason/priority text in-crop); encounter saved to `#patient/g1`, run reported success. After: identity band reads `Pat Placeholder Orthopedics intake Low` where `Jane Sample Knee pain referral High` was recorded (coverage 0.00) — halt before the click, nothing saved. Where the global rung finds the true row first (platform-dependent), the run instead saves to the CORRECT patient with identity verified. Audit evidence: `runs/validation/track-a/run-grow/` |
| look-alike row (`drift=lookalike`) | **wrong-action, silent → safe-halt** | before: a row with the same reason/priority directly above the target is pixel-identical inside the 160x64 crop (the NAME column is outside it); template rung confidence 1.0; saved to `#patient/p0`. After: the band's NAME text disagrees (`Taylor Duplicate ...`, coverage ~0.67 from the shared columns, below the 0.8 bar, with the replaced name a 10-char contiguous uncovered run) — halt before the click. Audit evidence: `runs/validation/track-a/run-lookalike/` |
| target row deleted (`drift=missing`) | **wrong-action, silent → safe-halt** | before: the neighbouring row occupies the recorded position and every rung that fires resolves to it; saved to `#patient/p2`. After: band reads `Alex Testcase Cardiology follow-up Medium` (coverage 0.00) — halt before the click, never click a look-alike. Audit evidence: `runs/validation/track-a/run-missing/` |
| empty list (`drift=empty`) | safe-halt | halts one step early: the sign-in step's postcondition asserts a data row's text as an "invariant" — before the 2026-07-09 mining fix `Cardiology follow-up`, after it a patient name from the task list (`Sam Specimen`): stability-selected mining rejects volatile fragments but cannot know a persistent data row from chrome, so this mechanism remains (disclosed under "known remaining") |
| slow renders 4s (`drift=slow`) | pass | postcondition polling + ladder retry absorb it (~20s run) |
| slow renders 12s (`drift=slow&slowms=12000`) | safe-halt | accurate report at the sign-in step (~5.5s postcondition window exceeded) |

Why the silent wrong-patient saves got through, end to end (audit analysis
— items 1 and 2 still describe the template/postcondition layers; item 3
is where the fix landed):

1. The discriminative evidence for a table-row button (the patient name)
   sits **outside** the template crop, and a strict-looking 0.985 template
   threshold does not separate "same button, different row" (in-crop text
   differences moved the score by less than 1.5%).
2. ~~The compiler's timestamp filter — added for OpenEMR, correctly — drops
   the patient banner from the click step's postconditions because the DOB
   ("1980-01-01") matches a date pattern. The surviving "new text"
   postcondition is the patient-agnostic `No encounters yet.`~~ → fixed
   2026-07-09: the volatility classifier's near/far date split keeps a
   date FAR from the recording date (a DOB) as identity data — the chart
   step now asserts `JaneSample—MRNP1—DOB1980-01-01` itself.
3. ~~Nothing downstream re-verifies identity~~ → the pre-click identity
   check now re-verifies the target's row text against the recorded
   context band, and halts before clicking when it disagrees.

## Track B — mid-run fault injection (MockMed)

State sabotaged *between* steps of a live replay via a wrapping backend.
Automated in `tests/e2e/test_chaos.py`.

| fault (injection point) | before → after | detail |
|---|---|---|
| target row deleted after sign-in | **wrong-action, silent → safe-halt** | mid-run twin of `drift=missing`. Before: saved to `#patient/p2`, reported success. After: identity band mismatch (coverage 0.00) halts before the click; nothing saved. Audit evidence: `runs/validation/track-b/run-delete-target-row/` |
| opaque modal before save | safe-halt | all rungs fail; ladder retries to the step timeout; aborts naming the save step; **no click fired into the overlay** |
| invisible click-shield before save | safe-halt | vision sees an unchanged screen, resolves correctly, clicks into the shield; nothing happens; postconditions abort. One neutralized click; no state written |
| Triage/Consult buttons swapped | pass (healed) | labels differ, so lower rungs re-locate the true target; the saved encounter has the correct type. Identical-looking swaps are the look-alike case above — those go wrong |
| focus stolen between click and type | **wrong-action, silent → recovered** | before: keystrokes fall on `<body>`; the encounter is saved with an **empty note** and the run reports success (TYPE steps were never verified, and parameterized values are *by design* excluded from every postcondition). After: typed-input verification sees the field region unchanged, re-clicks the field, retypes once, confirms the text landed — the run completes with the CORRECT note. A retry that also fails safe-halts. Audit evidence: `runs/validation/track-b/run-steal-focus-before-type/` |
| app navigates away before save | safe-halt | postconditions fail on the wrong screen; nothing typed or saved |
| save button renamed mid-run | pass (healed) | geometry rung resolves via unchanged landmarks; anchor healed; saved correctly |

## Track C — interaction-primitive taxonomy

One tiny demo per primitive against
`openadapt_flow/mockmed/static/widgets.html` (one control per `?panel=`).
Automated in `tests/e2e/test_primitives.py`. Exploration evidence:
`runs/validation/track-c/summary.json`.

| primitive | verdict | evidence (one line) |
|---|---|---|
| button / link click | supported | entire MockMed + OpenEMR corpus |
| checkbox / radio | supported | replay reproduces `Consent yes, priority Urgent.` |
| DOM modal dialog (open/confirm) | supported | replay reproduces `Survey response recorded.` |
| typeahead, fixed value | supported | type prefix + click suggestion replays exactly |
| typeahead, **parameterized** value | **partial / hazard (still open)** | recorded suggestion anchor can't match; geometry clicks whatever sits at the first-suggestion **position** — correct here by coincidence, unverified by construction (the status text embeds the parameter, so the compiler excluded it from postconditions). The identity fix does NOT arm here: the suggestion's only discriminative text is its own label (excluded as mutable evidence), and its row carries no other text — `context_text` compiles to None. Re-verified after the fix: still picks `Bob Baker` by position |
| table pagination (as demonstrated) | supported | Next → pick on page 2 replays |
| sorting that reorders targets | **wrong-action (caught) → safe-halt before any click** | before: replay vs `?presort=desc` clicked the wrong row and wrote its pick into app state before the postcondition halted. After: the identity band of the resolved row (`Echocardiogram North`) disagrees with the recorded row (`Basic metabolic panel South`) and the run halts with app state untouched. Reorder is still *unsupported* (the true row is never found) — but now safely |
| keyboard-only flow (Tab/type/Enter) | supported | `Request submitted for Rivera on ward North.` replays |
| native `<select>`, mouse | unsupported | the dropdown popup is browser chrome — it never appears in page screenshots (predicted in FINDINGS.md, confirmed) |
| native `<select>`, arrow keys | **hazard** | inert in this harness (macOS headless): recording changed nothing — no visual change AND no structural change (URL/title/tab count all static), so even the 2026-07-09 structural fallback has nothing to assert; the steps compile with **zero postconditions** and replay is a **vacuous success**, disclosed |
| native `<select>`, type-prefix + Enter | supported (workaround) | `Species set to Dog.` replays — the keyboard fallback FINDINGS.md predicted |
| native date input, typed digits | **partial / hazard → platform-shaped** | segment-, locale-, AND renderer-dependent. macOS shape: typing `07082026` produced value `70820-02-06` *at record time*; the initial fix replayed the same garbage byte-for-byte, and since 2026-07-09 the replay SAFE-HALTS at the type step instead (read-back cannot find the typed digits in the transformed rendering). Linux shape: the widget ignores the digits entirely — the recording is itself a no-op and the replay reproduces the no-op, verifying vacuously through the masked acceptance (focus rendering changes, no readable text). No wrong date value is written in either shape; the false abort and the vacuous verify are both disclosed in docs/LIMITS.md; the calendar popup is invisible browser chrome |
| iframe-heavy pages | supported | OpenEMR: 6+ nested iframes, modal-in-iframe-in-modal — vision-only replay never noticed (docs/showcase-openemr/FINDINGS.md) |
| new tab / `target=_blank` | **unsupported / silent → verified structurally (2026-07-09)** | the single-page frame never shows the new tab and before/after frames are identical, but the recorder now captures the backend's page count and the compiler mines a `NEW_TAB_OPENED` fallback postcondition — the step fails at replay if no tab actually opened. What happens INSIDE the new tab is still unobserved (single-window scope) |
| file upload | unsupported (structural) | the native file chooser is OS chrome; neither recordable nor drivable vision-only |
| drag-and-drop | unsupported (structural) | no DRAG in `ir.ActionKind`; the recorder has no drag API |
| conditional branching / loops | unsupported (structural) | `Workflow.steps` is a linear list; a demonstration cannot express if/else, and replay cannot skip or repeat steps |
| multi-window coordination | unsupported (structural) | `Backend` wraps exactly one page |

## Track D — parameterization depth (OpenEMR, live public demo)

Driver: `scripts/openemr_param_depth.py` (fresh browser per run, ≥30s
pacing, fake demo patients only; 8 demo sessions total including probes).
Question: the shipped benchmark parameterizes the note TEXT; what happens
when the PATIENT — a value that changes screen content — is a parameter?

| run | outcome | detail |
|---|---|---|
| `patient=Phil` (control) | pass | 18/18, 39.1s, 0 model calls, note verified on final screen |
| `patient=Susan` | safe-halt (false abort) | typed "Susan", results showed only "Underwood, Susan Ardmore"; the row click fell to the **geometry rung** (landmarks = column headers) and clicked the demonstrated **position** — which was Susan, the right patient. The chart opened, then the run aborted: step_008 asserts `No treatment intervention preferences recorded.`, a **Phil-dashboard state** baked in as an invariant. Evidence: `runs/validation/track-d/runs/run-susan-drift/` |
| cross-instance `/a/` | environment | `/a/` rejected its own published admin credentials that day (verified with DOM selectors — not a replay artifact). The replay executed the login correctly and safe-halted with an accurate report. Note: this probe was ad hoc — the committed script's `cross-instance` mode targets `/b/` only, so the `/a/` observation is not reproducible from the committed code |
| cross-instance `/b/` | safe-halt (false abort) | login **succeeded**, but the run halted at the login step's postconditions: `/b/` runs a different module set (no "Inventory" menu entry) and different calendar content, and both the menu-text assertion and the calendar REGION_STABLE were recorded on the main instance. Same version, different instance state → no transfer. Evidence: `runs/validation/track-d/runs/run-cross-instance-b/steps/step_004_after.png` |

Cross-VERSION drift was not testable: all public demo instances run
OpenEMR 8.0.0. Said plainly and skipped.

**The parameterization-depth answer (audit):** a parameter that changes
screen content is *position-bound and unverified*. Three interlocking
mechanisms (mechanism 1's "nothing verifies the identity of the clicked
row" is what the fix addresses: when the recorded row's context band embeds
the parameter's demo value, the pre-click check now requires the **run's**
value in the live band — position-resolved parameterized targets are no
longer click-blind, they must name the run's entity or the run halts):

1. **Anchors bind to the demonstrated value's pixels.** "Susan" cannot
   match a template/OCR anchor recorded on "Belford, Phil"; resolution
   degrades to geometry, which encodes *where* the demonstrated row was,
   not *which* row it is. With a single search result that is coincidentally
   correct; with multiple results it is the MockMed wrong-patient scenario
   on a real EMR — nothing verifies the identity of the clicked row.
2. **Parameterizing a value deletes its safety net.** The compiler
   (correctly) refuses to assert parameterized values — but that also
   stripped `Patient Messages for Belford, Phil` from the bundle the moment
   the patient became a parameter. The strongest identity check vanished
   *because* the value became variable.
3. **Assertions overfit to demonstrated state.** What remains asserts the
   demonstrated patient's dashboard (`No treatment intervention preferences
   recorded.`), another demo user's message fragment (`cleanly, no
   drainage.`), and a stray `:01` that slipped past the timestamp filter —
   all mutable, none identity-bearing. The same overfitting blocked the
   cross-instance replay at the login screen. → **Largely fixed 2026-07-09**
   (stability-selected mining; see the fresh-bundle table below): no
   timestamp/counter fragments, no other patients' content, and card/menu
   chrome preferred over data rows. Instance-stable state can still be
   mined (a module menu, a persistent data row; entry counts like
   `filtered from 56 total entries` were in this class until the review
   hardening rejected count phrases outright), so cross-instance transfer
   remains out of reach.

Also observed on the real app: the save step's geometry landmark is the
**recorded note text itself** — parameterized values leak into landmark
evidence, so healing quality silently degrades for any run whose parameter
differs from the demonstration (i.e., all of them). → **Fixed 2026-07-09**:
landmarks never embed a demo parameter value (or any volatile text), and a
compile-time lint fails the build if a demonstrated parameter value appears
in any text postcondition or any landmark's OCR text (REGION_STABLE
templates can still embed the value's rendered pixels — false-halt
direction; see the review-hardening known-remaining list).

### Track D re-run (2026-07-09, `feat/fix-postcondition-mining`)

One fresh record+compile and three paced replays against the live public
demo (fresh browser per session, >= 30 s apart, fake demo patients only,
$0, zero model calls; 4 demo sessions total). Every mined TEXT_PRESENT in
the fresh 17-step bundle, verbatim:

| step | intent | mined `text_present` |
|---|---|---|
| step_001 | type 'admin' | `admin` (the fixed login user — not a parameter) |
| step_004 | click 'Login' | `Calendar Finder Flow Recalls Messages Patient Fees Modules Procedures Admin Reports Miscellaneous Popups` (main menu chrome) |
| step_007 | press Enter (search) | `Showing1to1of1entries(filteredfrom56totalentries)` (results banner — historical: since the review hardening this string classifies as `count` and is rejected at compile time; a fresh compile mines a different candidate here) |
| step_008 | click 'Belford, Phil' | `TreatmentInterventionPreferences` (chart card title — the old miner asserted this card's Phil-specific *body* text) |
| step_012 | click pencil icon | `Last update` (column header — the old miner grabbed a message row's timestamp here; this is where `':01'` came from) |
| step_013 | click '+ Add' | `Calendar Finder Flow Recalls` (menu chrome) |
| step_016 | click 'Save as new message' | `Calendar Finder Flow Recalls Messages Patient Fees Modules Procedures Admin Reports Miscellaneous Popups` |

No clock fragments, no dates, no note text, no patient rows; the
parameter-leakage lint passed on the fresh bundle. Remaining vacuous steps:
the parameterized TYPE steps (by design — their value is verified at
runtime by typed-input verification) and the focusing click/scroll steps
listed with no `text_present`, which carry REGION_STABLE instead.

| run | outcome | detail |
|---|---|---|
| `patient=Phil` (control) | safe-halt (false abort) at step_014, **14/17** | **no postcondition failure anywhere** — steps 012 and 013, where every 2026-07-08 replay died on `text_present ':01'`, passed cleanly. The halt is the *identity-layer* band-order fragility described under "Exposed by this fix" above; 0 wrong actions, note not saved |
| `patient=Phil` (control, repeat) | safe-halt (false abort) at step_014, **14/17** | identical failure signature — reproducible, so it is filed as a real finding, not flake |
| `patient=Susan` (drift) | safe-halt at step_008, **8/17** | the parameterized-target position-bound limit documented above: the recorded row band carries Phil's phone/SSN/DOB (the demo value "Phil" itself is the target's own label, so param re-anchor mode does not arm) and the live band names Susan — the run refuses to click. Safe, correct, and still the P1 limitation |

Bottom line: the `':01'`-class postcondition false-halt is gone (0
postcondition failures in 3/3 live replays); the control run's remaining
blocker moved to the identity layer, was disclosed above, and has since
been fixed by the `feat/fix-wrong-actions` order-insensitive matcher
rework (the step_014 band shape is pinned verified in
`tests/test_identity.py`; the 14/17 runs above are the historical record
under the initial matcher).

## Failure modes ranked by severity

**P0 — silent wrong-state writes (5 reproductions). FIXED 2026-07-08.**
Row-level data drift (grow/look-alike/delete) redirected the whole tail of
a workflow to the wrong entity, and focus loss silently dropped typed
input; all mechanisms ended in a green report. Confidence was highest
(template rung, ~1.0) precisely when the click was wrongest, and the
irreversible-step risk gate never engaged because it keyed on *resolution
rung*, not on *target identity*. Fixed by the pre-click identity check
(the resolved point's own row text must match the recorded band —
order-insensitive token matching with an uncovered-residue cap — or, for
a parameterized target, the run-value-substituted band) and by typed-input
verification (read-back OCR of the typed value; diff-only acceptance
reserved for the masked no-new-text shape; one guarded refocus-and-retype
retry only when nothing changed, then halt). **Residual gaps, disclosed:**
(a) when the live band is *unreadable* (OCR finds nothing even at 2x —
e.g. an icon-only row), reversible steps proceed exactly as before with
the step flagged in the report (`identity: unreadable`), and only
compile-time-marked irreversible steps refuse — risk is opt-in via
`risk_overrides` and never auto-assigned, so in a default-compiled bundle
that refusal branch never runs (docs/LIMITS.md states this in the
dangerous list); (b) targets whose only discriminative text is their own
label (parameterized typeahead suggestions), and bands under 12 squashed
characters (too generic to discriminate), compile with no context band
and stay unverified; (c) ~~names within OCR-jitter similarity (>= 0.7
whole-token ratio, e.g. "Jane"/"Janet") are indistinguishable from
misreads and verify~~ — this gap was the mechanism of the THIRD
wrong-patient reopening and was FIXED 2026-07-10 (see that fix update:
near-name siblings now mismatch; only characteristic OCR char-class
confusions are treated as misreads — and after the FOURTH reopening
later that day, names equal only UNDER those confusion classes
(Neil/Nell) refuse too: when the only evidence is confusion
equivalence, the run aborts rather than verifies; the residual verify
classes are listed in docs/LIMITS.md "Known remaining");
(d) typed-input read-back can false-abort on widgets
that transform the value while typing (the native-date row in Track C),
and the refocus re-click / select-all retry assumptions are disclosed in
docs/LIMITS.md.

**P1 — parameterization is position-bound and self-disarming (Track D).
PARTIALLY ADDRESSED.** Changing a content-bearing parameter still removes
its own assertions and falls back to position resolution; but the click is
no longer blind — the identity check's param mode substitutes the RUN's
value into the recorded band and requires the WHOLE substituted band to
match before acting (the MockMed wrong-patient scenario on a real EMR now
halts instead of clicking, and since 2026-07-09 a row that merely mentions
the run's value no longer passes). Strictness cost, disclosed: when the
entity's own row text varies with the entity (a search result carries the
surname), the substituted band cannot match and the run halts even on the
correct row — verified re-anchoring for such rows is future work
(docs/LIMITS.md). ~~Landmark leakage of recorded parameter values
(healing-quality degradation) remains open~~ — fixed 2026-07-09: landmark
hygiene plus the compile-time parameter-leakage lint.

**P2 — cosmetic global drift zeroes availability (still open; out of scope of the 2026-07-08 fix).** Font +3px, 125% zoom,
or dsf 2 → false abort at step 000. Healing covers theme/move/rename but
nothing that rescales or reflows. Multi-scale matching stops at 1.18x, and
REGION_STABLE phashes break on reflow.

**P2 — assertions overfit to instance/day state. LARGELY FIXED 2026-07-09.**
Mining now selects for stability instead of novelty: clock/near-date
fragments, counters and low-entropy noise are rejected (the `':01'` class
is structurally excluded — verified live), candidates must persist across
the recording's own frames, ranking prefers semantically-near alphabetic
text, and a DOB-class far date in an identity banner is deliberately KEPT
as identity evidence instead of being eaten by the old blanket timestamp
filter. The review hardening extended the reject set to month-name dates,
relative-time phrases, counts/pagination, badge counters and dot-clocks
(all reviewer-verified evasions; see above). **Still open within this
item:** text that is stable *within the recording* but instance-specific
(a module menu, a persistent data row like MockMed's `Sam Specimen`) can
still be mined — bundles still do not transfer between same-version
instances, and per-tenant re-recording remains the working assumption.

**P2 — identity band order-fragility on dialog clicks (exposed 2026-07-09,
pre-existing). FIXED 2026-07-09.** See "Exposed by this fix" above: the
recorded context band for a click inside a modal captures background
chrome whose OCR segmentation/order does not reproduce, and the initial
order-sensitive coverage matcher false-aborted on it (live OpenEMR control
runs capped at 14/17 — safe, 0 wrong actions, reproducible 2/2). Fixed by
the `feat/fix-wrong-actions` matcher rework: token-wise order-insensitive
matching with re-validated look-alike margins; the permuted modal-band
shape is pinned verified at 1.0 in `tests/test_identity.py`.

**P3 — vacuous successes. PARTIALLY FIXED 2026-07-09.** Steps that mined
nothing visual now fall back to structural postconditions (URL_CHANGED /
TITLE_CHANGED / NEW_TAB_OPENED) when the recorder captured structural
observations — the new-tab click is now verified. Still vacuous, disclosed:
actions with no visual AND no structural effect (the inert native
`<select>`), and any bundle recorded on a backend without structural
observations (native OS/RDP).

**P3 — verification blind spots inherent to pixels (still open).** The invisible
click-shield shows the runtime cannot distinguish "app ignored the click"
from "click never reached the app"; native browser chrome (select popups,
date pickers, file choosers) is invisible to screenshots.

## What held up

Reported with equal honesty:

- **No crashes, anywhere.** Every failure was a reported, per-step halt.
- **No false success without a wrong action first.** When the replay acted
  on the *right* targets, postconditions never green-lit a failed outcome.
- The halt machinery is sound when evidence dies loudly: opaque overlays,
  navigation hijacks, empty states, and 12s stalls all stopped the run at
  the right step with an accurate, named reason.
- Healing works as advertised for *labeled* drift: mid-run swaps and
  renames of text-bearing controls resolved to the correct targets.
- Timeout envelope behaved as designed (4s recovers; 12s halts).
- On the live OpenEMR demo, the compiled arm remains 0-model-call and
  passed its control run; the Susan run's wrong-free halt shows the
  postcondition system catching real cross-patient drift when an
  identity-bearing assertion happens to survive compilation.

```bash
# MockMed tracks (A/B/C) — hermetic, run in CI:
pytest tests/e2e/test_perturbation.py tests/e2e/test_chaos.py \
       tests/e2e/test_primitives.py -q

# OpenEMR track D — live public demo, paced, fake patients only, $0:

No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is read by any of the above; the grounder rung is
disabled throughout.
