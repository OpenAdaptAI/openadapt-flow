"""Desktop recording entry points and the desktop parity metric.

Two ways to produce a compile-ready recording of a **desktop** demonstration,
and one helper to check how close the resulting bundle is to a DOM-armed web
bundle.

1. Live record (``record_desktop_demo``) — PREFERRED, and the path that
   reaches web parity
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Drive a live :class:`~openadapt_flow.backend.Backend` (a ``WindowsBackend``
   pointed at the in-guest agent) through :class:`~openadapt_flow.recorder.Recorder`.
   Because the recorder queries the backend's structured layer at each click
   (``StructuralActionBackend.structural_locator_at``), a Windows backend arms
   every click step with a **UIA ``AutomationId`` / role+name locator** — the
   native-desktop equivalent of the DOM ``#id`` / role+name a browser
   (``dom_arm``) bundle carries. The compiled bundle therefore has the SAME
   shape as a web bundle *including the structural top rung*, so replay resolves
   targets deterministically (the ``structural`` rung) with the visual ladder as
   fallback. This closes the desktop→web parity gap.

2. Offline convert (``openadapt_flow.adapters.capture.convert_capture``) —
   available, with ONE precise gap
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   An ``openadapt-capture`` session (recorded with NO live automation backend
   attached) converts into the identical recording layout (``meta.json`` +
   ``events.jsonl`` + ``frames/``) and compiles into the identical bundle
   shape. The ONE thing it cannot carry is the **structural locator**: capture
   records mouse/keyboard/video only — there is no live UIA tree at conversion
   time to read an ``AutomationId`` from — so ``anchor.structural`` is None on
   every step and replay uses the VISUAL ladder (template/ocr/geometry). This is
   an honest limitation of offline capture, not of the compiler: the bundle is
   fully valid and replays; it simply lacks the deterministic top rung.

   FOLLOW-UP to close it (out of this module's file scope): re-arm a
   capture-converted recording against a live UIA tree — replay each recorded
   click point through ``WindowsBackend.structural_locator_at`` on the live app
   and write the returned locator onto the anchor. That belongs next to the
   browser ``dom_arm`` step (``benchmark/dom_arm.py``) as a ``uia_arm`` pass and
   is tracked separately; it is not implemented here.

:func:`structural_armed_coverage` reports the parity fraction (share of click
steps carrying a structural locator) for either path, so a test or the e2e
harness can assert the live path is armed and quantify the offline gap.
