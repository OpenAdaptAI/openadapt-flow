    The runtime resolves targets by VISION alone (screenshot in, clicks out);
    that never changes. But *identity verification* -- proving the resolved
    target is the recorded entity, not a look-alike sibling -- does not have
    to be OCR-based when the backend can hand back the real, structured
    characters under a point.

    An adversarial review proved the OCR-only identity path cannot close the
    same-name / same-DOB glyph-collapse case: two DIFFERENT patients whose MRN
    differs only by an O/0 or l/1 glyph ("MG4408" vs "MG44O8") render to a
    byte-identical OCR band -- the same input a legit re-read produces -- so
    no function downstream of OCR can distinguish them (see docs/LIMITS.md and
    benchmark/dense_surface/DENSE_SURFACE.md). The escape is to stop relying
    on OCR for identity where a higher-fidelity signal exists.

    ``structured_text_at`` returns that higher-fidelity signal: the accessible
    / DOM text at (or around) a coordinate, in the REAL characters --
    "MG4408" with a genuine digit 0, not an OCR guess. Backends implement it
    from whatever structured layer they own:

    - a browser backend (Playwright) reads the DOM element under the point
      (``elementFromPoint`` -> row/cell ``textContent`` + ``aria-label``);
    - a native desktop backend reads the accessibility tree -- Windows UI
      Automation ``Name``/``Value``/text, or macOS AX attributes. Crucially,
      an element lacking a stable ``AutomationId`` usually STILL exposes
      Name/Value text, so UIA/AX identity is viable on most native apps even
      where an AutomationId-keyed selector is not.

    The identity ladder treats DOM and UIA/AX text identically -- both are
    "structured text". A pure-pixel substrate (Citrix/RDP/VDI, or a backend
    with no a11y tree) returns None from every point, and identity falls back
    to the OCR name+DOB-primary tier (docs/LIMITS.md). This is an ADDITIVE
    identity capability: the 4-method vision resolution protocol
    (:class:`Backend`) is unchanged.

    The runtime resolves targets by a LADDER (see
    :mod:`openadapt_flow.runtime.resolver`). Its top rung is structural: where
    the backend owns a structured layer (a browser's DOM, a native app's UIA/AX
    tree) the runtime re-finds the recorded target as an ELEMENT and acts on its
    center DETERMINISTICALLY, instead of pixel-matching a template that render
    drift (relabel, theme, zoom, layout shift) can defeat. The desktop benchmark
    measured UIA execution 21/21 vs compiled visual replay 6/21 under drift.

    This is the thesis shift from "vision-only" to "deterministic compiled
    automation with visual FALLBACK". It is ADDITIVE and backend-optional: a
    pixel-only substrate (RDP/Citrix/canvas, or a backend with no structured
    layer) simply does not implement it, and resolution falls through to the
    visual rungs (template/ocr/geometry) UNCHANGED -- the healthcare/Citrix
    floor is never removed.

    Crucially, the structurally-resolved point flows through the IDENTICAL click
    path as any visual resolution, so the pre-click identity gate and the
    irreversible risk gate still fire on it: structure makes identity STRONGER
    (an exact element), it never bypasses it.

    Two methods, mirroring the record/replay split of the identity capability
    (:class:`IdentityBackend`):

    - ``structural_locator_at`` runs at RECORD time: given the demonstrated
      click point, return a STABLE structural locator the runtime can re-resolve
      later (a DOM ``#id`` / role+name, a UIA ``AutomationId`` / role+name).
    - ``locate_structural`` runs at REPLAY time: given that recorded locator,
      find the element on the LIVE surface and return its center point.

    Each returns None when the capability is momentarily unavailable, the
    element is absent/ambiguous, or the substrate has no structured layer at
    that point (never raises) -- resolution then uses the visual ladder.
