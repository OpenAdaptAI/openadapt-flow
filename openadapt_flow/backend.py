    The runtime resolves targets by VISION alone (screenshot in, clicks out);

    target is the recorded entity, not a look-alike sibling -- does not have
    to be OCR-based when the backend can hand back the real, structured
    characters under a point.

    An adversarial review proved the OCR-only identity path cannot close the
    same-name / same-DOB glyph-collapse case: two DIFFERENT patients whose MRN
    differs only by an O/0 or l/1 glyph ("MG4408" vs "MG44O8") render to a
    byte-identical OCR band -- the same input a legit re-read produces -- so
    no function downstream of OCR can distinguish them (see docs/LIMITS.md and
    benchmark/dense_surface/DENSE_SURFACE.md). The escape is to stop relying
    on OCR for identity where a higher-fidelity signal exists.

    ``structured_text_at`` returns that higher-fidelity signal: the accessible
    / DOM text at (or around) a coordinate, in the REAL characters --
    "MG4408" with a genuine digit 0, not an OCR guess. Backends implement it

      accessible text. Crucially,
      an element lacking a stable ``AutomationId`` usually STILL exposes
      Name/Value text, so UIA/AX identity is viable on most native apps even
      where an AutomationId-keyed selector is not.

    The identity ladder treats DOM and UIA/AX text identically -- both are
    "structured text". A pure-pixel substrate (Citrix/RDP/VDI, or a backend
    with no a11y tree) returns None from every point, and identity falls back

    center DETERMINISTICALLY, instead of pixel-matching a template that render
    drift (relabel, theme, zoom, layout shift) can defeat. The desktop benchmark
    measured UIA execution 21/21 vs compiled visual replay 6/21 under drift.

    This is the thesis shift from "vision-only" to "deterministic compiled
