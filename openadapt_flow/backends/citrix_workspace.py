"""Citrix Workspace-window pixel backend: drive a Citrix Workspace/Receiver
SESSION WINDOW as a no-DOM pixel surface.

Over Citrix, the local machine holds a **Citrix Workspace/Viewer window that
paints the pixels of a remote ICA/HDX session**; there is no in-guest agent on
our side of the ICA boundary and **UIA/MSAA/DOM do not cross ICA**. So the
production Accuro-over-Citrix wire is a **local-OS backend that screenshots the
Workspace window and injects OS-level input into it** -- pixel-only, no
structural/identity layer, resolution on the visual floor (template ->
template_global -> ocr -> geometry), identity on the OCR name+DOB tier.

That backend already exists: :class:`~openadapt_flow.backends.remote_display.RemoteDisplayBackend`
(window-scoped ``CGWindowListCreateImage`` / ``PrintWindow`` capture + ``CGEvent``
/ ``SendInput`` injection, per-monitor-v2 DPI, fail-loud when input trust is
missing). It is target-window-agnostic: point it at the Citrix Workspace window
by owner/title and the *same* capture+inject code runs. This module is the thin,
**Citrix-specific preset** over it:

* :data:`CITRIX_WINDOW_OWNERS` -- the per-platform Workspace/Viewer window owner
  names (the "magic strings" a caller would otherwise have to know).
* :func:`default_citrix_owner` -- pick the host's Citrix owner.
* :class:`CitrixWorkspaceBackend` -- a ``RemoteDisplayBackend`` that defaults its
  target owner to the host's Citrix Workspace window and documents the ICA
  constraints. It conforms to the base :class:`~openadapt_flow.backend.Backend`
  protocol UNCHANGED, so the resolver ladder + effect verification run over it
  exactly as over any other backend, and -- like ``RemoteDisplayBackend`` -- it
  deliberately implements ONLY the base protocol (NOT ``StructuralBackend`` /
  ``IdentityBackend`` / ``StructuralActionBackend``), so the structural rung is
  unavailable by construction: the Citrix pixel floor.

Validation status (see ``benchmark/citrix_workspace/README.md``):
* DONE: window-scoped pixel capture + OS input injection + all the fail-loud
  safety gates (frame-freshness, occlusion, input-trust, DPI-consistency) are
  inherited from ``RemoteDisplayBackend`` and are exercised END-TO-END by the
  record->compile->replay + drift contract over the no-DOM canvas stand-in
  (``benchmark/canvas_ladder`` fixture) through the ``WindowClient`` seam.
* PENDING: validation against a REAL Citrix Workspace window on a live CVAD/DaaS
  ICA/HDX session (needs the trial lab + a GUI host with Screen-Recording /
  Accessibility trust). Everything upstream of the window is already proven; the
  ICA-specific delta is HDX codec artifacts, ICA compression, and the exact
  Workspace-window owner/title + a session-lock readiness marker. See the
  README's "Point at the real CVAD lab" runbook.
