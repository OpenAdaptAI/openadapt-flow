"""Local-OS pixel backend: drive a REMOTE-DISPLAY CLIENT WINDOW, pixels only.

This is the faithful **Citrix analog** the healthcare pilot actually reuses. Over
Citrix, the local machine holds a **Citrix Workspace/Receiver window that paints
the pixels of a remote session**; there is no in-guest agent on our side of the
ICA boundary and **UIA/MSAA does not cross ICA**. The production Accuro-over-Citrix
wire is therefore NOT the RDP protocol client (:mod:`openadapt_flow.backends.rdp_backend`
speaks RDP, which is not ICA) — it is a **local-OS backend that screenshots the
Workspace client window and injects OS-level input into it**. This module is that
backend, built on macOS (Quartz / AppKit) against any on-screen client window.

For the proof on infra we control the client window is the **Parallels Desktop VM
window** showing the guest desktop: same *class* of substrate as Citrix Workspace
— host-side pixels of a remote guest, host OS input injected into the window, and
**no access to the guest UIA tree through the window**. Swapping the target from
the Parallels window to a "Citrix Workspace"/"Accuro" window is a one-line title
change; the screenshot + inject code is identical. (What real Citrix adds — HDX
compression, network latency, DPI/credential/lock-screen drift — is documented in
``docs/desktop/CITRIX_PIXEL.md``, not simulated here.)

Faithful pixel-only property (the whole point):

* :meth:`RemoteDisplayBackend.screenshot` captures **only the client window's
  pixels** (``CGWindowListCreateImage`` by window id) — the driving process sees
  the remote display, nothing else.
* input is injected at the **host OS level** (``CGEvent`` mouse / keyboard /
  wheel) into that window, mapped from screenshot-pixel space to screen points.
* the backend deliberately does NOT implement ``StructuralBackend``,
  ``IdentityBackend`` or ``StructuralActionBackend``. So the resolver's
  ``structural`` (UIA) rung is **unavailable** and record identity still uses
  qualified pixel/OCR regions. It may implement the separate
  ``ExecutionContextIdentityBackend`` contract when explicitly configured with
  PHI-free on-screen application/workflow/session markers or a live session
  digest observer. Those observers never expose captured text.

Permission reality (macOS, and the honest failure mode): window capture needs
**Screen Recording** permission and input injection needs **Accessibility**
permission for the driving app (Terminal / the Python host). If Accessibility is
not granted, ``CGEventPost`` is **silently dropped** — a dropped click that looked
like success is the exact "silent wrong action" this project refuses. So every
input method FAILS LOUD (raises :class:`RemoteDisplayError`) when the process is
not Accessibility-trusted; a caller never mistakes a no-op for a completed action.

The macOS bindings are isolated behind :class:`MacWindowClient` (a small
:class:`WindowClient` seam) so the coordinate math, the pixel<->point mapping, and
the fail-loud contract are unit-testable with a fake client and no live window.
The Windows-host counterpart of that seam is
:class:`openadapt_flow.backends.win32_window_client.Win32WindowClient`
(PrintWindow/BitBlt client-area capture + SendInput injection, per-monitor-v2
DPI, same fail-loud contract); :class:`RemoteDisplayBackend` picks the host's
client automatically when none is injected.
