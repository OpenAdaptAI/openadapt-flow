"""Benchmark harness: replay a compiled workflow bundle N times and aggregate.

``run_bench`` replays the bundle ``n`` times, each iteration against a fresh
backend produced by ``backend_factory`` and a freshly loaded ``Workflow``
(heals are applied in memory during a replay and must not leak between
iterations), and aggregates success rate, latency percentiles, rung usage,
heal counts, and model call/cost totals into a ``bench.json`` written under
``run_root``.

The Replayer is imported lazily (``from openadapt_flow.runtime import
Replayer``) inside :func:`run_bench`, so unit tests can monkeypatch
``sys.modules["openadapt_flow.runtime"]`` with a fake.
