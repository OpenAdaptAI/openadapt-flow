"""Claude computer-use agent baseline for the benchmark.

A minimal but fair agent loop: it drives the SAME ``PlaywrightBackend`` the
compiled replayer uses, vision-only — screenshots go to the model; clicks,
typed text, and key presses come back. The task is stated in user-intent
terms (no coordinates, no step-by-step script), the phrasing a real user
would give a computer-use agent.

Model and API facts (checked 2026-07-08 against the Anthropic docs):

- Model: ``claude-sonnet-5`` (the current Sonnet).
- Computer-use tool ``computer_20251124`` with beta header
  ``computer-use-2025-11-24``.
- List pricing: $3.00 / MTok input, $15.00 / MTok output. Prompt-cache
  writes (5-minute TTL) bill at 1.25x input and cache reads at 0.1x input.
  An introductory $2.00 / $10.00 rate applies through 2026-08-31; costs
  here are computed at the durable list price so the numbers stay
  comparable after the promo (billed cost today is therefore BELOW every
  cap computed here — the safe direction).

Loop mechanics:

- screenshot -> model -> execute tool actions -> repeat, until the model
  stops requesting actions, the ``max_actions`` budget (default 25) is hit,
  or the run's list-price cost exceeds ``max_cost_usd`` (default $1.50 —
  a hard per-run cost cap, checked after every API call, so a run can
  overshoot the cap by at most one call's marginal cost).
- Every executed action returns a settled screenshot in its ``tool_result``
  (the same settle logic the replayer uses), so the model always sees the
  post-action state without spending an extra action on it.
- Conversation history is bounded: only the last ``keep_screenshots``
  (default 3) screenshot image blocks are kept; older ones are replaced with
  a small text stub.

Prompt caching:

- ``cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`` breakpoints are placed on the
  computer-use tool definition (stable across the whole run) and on the
  last content block of the newest user message each turn; stale per-turn
  markers are stripped so the request never exceeds the 4-breakpoint limit.
- Interaction with screenshot truncation: ``_truncate_screenshots``
  rewrites the screenshot block ~``keep_screenshots`` turns back into a
  text stub each turn, mutating the prefix at that point. Cache matching
  falls back to the longest still-valid earlier prefix (the API checks
  ~20 content blocks behind each breakpoint), so everything before the
  newly stubbed block — the ever-growing stable prefix of stubs and
  assistant turns — is still served from cache; only the last few turns
  (the intact screenshots) are re-processed. Per-call usage
  (``input_tokens``, ``cache_creation_input_tokens``,
  ``cache_read_input_tokens``) is logged so the realized hit rate is
  visible in the run log.

    """Run the computer-use agent loop against a backend until done.

    Args:
        backend: A ``Backend`` (the same PlaywrightBackend the replayer
            uses) already navigated to the target app.
        task: Natural-language task prompt (see :func:`triage_task_prompt`).
        client: Anthropic client; when None, one is constructed with the key
            from ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` or ``~/.anthropic/api_key``.
        model: Model ID.
        max_actions: Hard budget on executed computer actions.
        keep_screenshots: How many recent screenshots to keep in history.
        max_tokens: Per-response output token cap.
        max_cost_usd: Hard per-run cost cap at list price. Checked after
            every API call — so a run can overshoot the cap by at most one
            call's marginal cost; when exceeded, the loop stops with
            ``stopped="cost_cap"`` and returns normally (a capped run is
            a recorded data point, not an exception).
        log: Per-API-call usage logger (cache hit rate visibility); None
            disables per-call logging.
        ledger: Optional :class:`UsageLedger` to record usage into. Pass
            one to keep the run's paid usage observable even when this
            function raises mid-run (see :class:`UsageLedger`); when None
            a private ledger is used.

    Returns:
        An :class:`AgentRunResult` with counters, cost, and the final
        screenshot. Task success is judged separately (``verify``).
