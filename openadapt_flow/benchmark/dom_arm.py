"""DOM-selector benchmark arm: the incumbent comparison.

The repo's other benchmarks compare compiled vision replay against a
computer-use agent. The strongest external criticism of that comparison is
that the real incumbent for "run the same GUI workflow 500 times" is not an
agent — it is a DOM-selector script (Playwright/Selenium): also $0 per run,
also fast, and it sidesteps OCR entirely on a browser backend. This module
runs that experiment instead of arguing about it.

Three arms, one frozen schedule, one arm-independent success check:

- **compiled**: the existing vision-anchored compiled replay
  (:func:`openadapt_flow.benchmark.run_benchmark._compiled_run`), healing
  enabled as always.
- **dom** (positional) and **dom_named** (name-filtered):
  :func:`dom_script` — a Playwright script written the way a competent
  practitioner writes one (this is a STEELMAN, not a strawman): resilient
  user-facing selectors in Playwright's documented priority order
  (``get_by_role``/``get_by_label``/``get_by_text``), no retries beyond
  Playwright's own auto-waiting, standard timeouts, and an explicit final
  outcome assertion. The task spec underdetermines exactly one selector
  (which referral row to open), so BOTH readings run as arms: the
  positional first-row reading and the identity reading keyed to the
  demonstrated patient. Every selector choice is documented inline.

Both arms run (a) the hybrid benchmark's exact frozen 20-slot schedule
(:data:`SCHEDULE`: 14 clean + 6 drifted — ``notice``/``reqfield``/
``modal-once``, two each) and (b) the validation suite's perturbation
drift modes (:data:`PERTURBATIONS`: lookalike, missing, grow, sort, theme,
rename, move, typelabel). Success is judged for BOTH arms by the hybrid
benchmark's own arm-independent check
(:func:`~openadapt_flow.benchmark.hybrid_benchmark.verify_hybrid_final`):
OCR of the final screenshot must show the saved-encounter evidence AND the
right patient, with wrong-type writes flagged — so this head-to-head is
judged by the identical bar. Wrong-action events are recorded per arm:
DOM scripts have their own wrong-target failure modes (first-row selection
after sort/grow/lookalike/missing picking a different patient) and this
benchmark measures them rather than assuming either way.

Everything here is $0 and deterministic: no model calls in either arm.

    """The selector script, as named steps in execution order.

    Selector policy — Playwright's own documented best practice, applied
    the way a competent practitioner applies it:

    1. ``get_by_role`` with the accessible name for anything clickable
       (role + name is the contract a user relies on, survives DOM
       restructuring and all styling changes).
    2. ``get_by_label`` for form fields (MockMed associates every input
       with an explicit ``<label for=...>``).
    3. ``get_by_text`` only for asserting on rendered content (the saved
       banner), never for targeting controls.
    4. ``data-testid``: NOT USED — the MockMed markup exposes no test ids
       (checked: it has DOM ``id`` attributes only, no ``data-testid``
       contract).
    5. Brittle CSS/XPath: avoided entirely; nothing here needs it. The
       app's ``id`` attributes (``#signin``, ``#save-encounter``,
       ``#open-p1``...) would work, but Playwright guidance prefers
       user-facing attributes, and row ids like ``#open-p1`` bake a
       DATABASE id into the automation (see the BENCHMARK.md variant
       analysis for what an id-keyed script would change).

    Two variants of the ONE ambiguous step, both benchmarked as separate
    arms — the referral-opening step is where the task spec
    underdetermines the selector:

    - ``target_patient=None`` (arm ``dom``, positional): the first row's
      Open button — the literal reading of the position-phrased spec
      ("open the FIRST referral task in the list").
    - ``target_patient="Jane Sample"`` (arm ``dom_named``,
      name-filtered): the Open button inside the row whose accessible
      name carries the demonstrated patient — the identity reading. This
      hardcodes the patient into the script exactly as the compiled
      arm's recorded identity band does; the two arms differ in failure
      semantics, not in whether they encode the patient.

    No retries beyond Playwright's built-in auto-waiting; standard
    (default, 30 s) timeouts; one explicit outcome assertion at the end —
    a competent script never assumes the final click worked.

    Args:
        page: A Playwright ``Page`` (or a test double with the same
            ``get_by_role``/``get_by_label``/``get_by_text`` surface).
        note_text: This run's parameterized note.

Date: {date}. The incumbent comparison. For "run the same browser workflow
N times", the incumbent is not a computer-use agent — it is a
Playwright/Selenium script: also $0 per run, also fast, no OCR anywhere.
This benchmark runs that incumbent head-to-head against the compiled
vision replay on the same task, the same frozen drift schedule, and the
same arm-independent success check, and reports whichever way it comes
out.

**Task** (MockMed, the bundled demo clinic app; fake data only): sign in as
`nurse.demo`, open the first referral task, create a New Encounter of type
Triage, enter a parameterized note (distinct per arm and slot), save.

**The DOM arms are steelmen — both of them.** Playwright's documented
best practices throughout: `get_by_label` for fields, `get_by_role` +
accessible name for buttons, an explicit final outcome assertion,
auto-waiting, standard timeouts, no retries, no sleeps, no brittle
CSS/XPath (the app exposes no `data-testid` contract). The task spec
("open the FIRST referral task") underdetermines one selector, so both
readings run as separate arms: **DOM (positional)** clicks the first
row's Open button — the literal reading — and **DOM (name-filtered)**
clicks the Open button in the row named `{TARGET_PATIENT}` — the
identity reading, hardcoding the demonstrated patient exactly as the
compiled arm's recorded identity band does. Every selector choice is
documented in `openadapt_flow/benchmark/dom_arm.py`.

## Verdict

{_dom_verdict(results)}

![schedule success rate and perturbation outcome matrix](outcome_matrix.png)

## Head-to-head on the frozen 20-slot schedule

The hybrid benchmark's exact schedule: {len(sched['conditions'])} slots,
{n_drift} drifted ({sched['drift_fraction']:.0%} — two each of `notice`,
`reqfield`, `modal-once`), identical condition per slot index for every
arm.

{headline_table}
Read the maintenance row with its asymmetry in view (details in the
section below): a DOM maintenance event means a human edits the script;
a compiled drift halt is not counted there but is not free either — it
takes a fresh one-minute demonstration or an agent fallback. Neither
number is "zero cost"; they are different currencies.

Per-condition outcomes on the schedule:

| condition | {' | '.join(_MD_ARM_LABELS[a] for a in arms)} |
|---{'|---' * len(arms)}|
{schedule_table}
## Head-to-head on the perturbation drift modes

The validation suite's drift matrix (PR #12/#13) plus `sort` and
`typelabel`; every mode is flag-gated in the MockMed app and deterministic.
One fresh browser per run.

{wrong_block}

Totals: {', '.join(
    f"{_MD_ARM_LABELS[a]} {totals[a]['wrong_action_count']}" for a in arms
)} (schedule + perturbation runs).

## Measurement validity — where the judge itself is the weak link

{dispute_block}

## Maintenance asymmetry, stated honestly

A DOM script that drift breaks **loudly** (selector timeout, failed
outcome assertion) stays broken until a human edits the script — every
such run is counted above as a maintenance event (DOM total:
{totals['dom']['maintenance_count']}). A DOM script that drift breaks
**silently** (wrong-action rows) is worse: it needs the same human edit
plus someone noticing the bad writes first, and every run until then
mutates the wrong record.

The compiled bundle is never hand-edited: cosmetic drift is absorbed by
the resolution ladder (heals), and non-absorbable drift ends in a safe
halt with an accurate report. That is not free either — a persistently
halting bundle needs a fresh one-minute demonstration, or an agent
fallback (see the hybrid benchmark) — but it fails closed, and the
recovery path does not involve reading someone else's selector code.

## Variant analysis — the selector variants, measured and unmeasured

The one genuinely ambiguous step is opening the referral, and the two
readings of it are both benchmarked as arms above ("first row" vs "the
row named `{TARGET_PATIENT}`"). On hardcoding: an earlier draft of this
report dismissed the name-filtered variant because "the patient becomes
a hardcoded constant" — that framing was asymmetric and is retracted.
**The compiled arm hardcodes the same constant**: its recorded identity
band embeds "{TARGET_PATIENT} Knee pain referral High" and every replay
checks the live row against it before clicking. Both identity-keyed
approaches encode the demonstrated patient; they differ in HOW the
identity got captured (demonstration vs hand-authored selector) and in
failure semantics (fail-closed halt vs fail-closed timeout), not in
whether the patient is encoded. The positional variant is the one that
encodes no identity at all — and the wrong-action column shows what
that costs.

Unmeasured variants, for completeness:

- Keying to the app's DOM id (`#open-p1`) would behave like the
  name-filtered arm on this matrix (`p1` IS the patient identity, as a
  database key instead of a display name) — id-in-selector is what
  Playwright's guidance steers away from, and display names are the
  more maintainable spelling of the same choice.
- Nothing in the selector toolbox fixes `notice`, `reqfield`, or
  `modal-once` without a human adding new steps — the same conditions
  that halt the compiled replay.

## Methodology

- **Record + compile once** (compiled arm only): the demo is recorded via
  the Playwright demo driver and compiled into a vision-anchored bundle;
  one-time, excluded from per-run latency, same as every other benchmark
  here. The DOM arms need no demonstration — a human wrote them from the
  task spec instead (~the same one-off effort, different skill).
- **Identical environments.** Every run of every arm gets a fresh
  chromium (1280x800, deviceScaleFactor=1) against the same locally
  served MockMed app; drift is injected via `?drift=` query flags, so
  conditions are exactly reproducible.
- **Different interfaces, deliberately.** The compiled arm is
  vision-only (screenshots in, pixel clicks out). The DOM arms drive the
  page through selectors — that IS the comparison. The two DOM arms
  differ in exactly ONE selector (positional vs name-filtered referral
  row), isolating spec phrasing from everything else.
- **Same success criterion, implemented once.** `verify_final_state` on
  the final screenshot: OCR must find the `Encounter saved` banner AND a
  `Triage — <note>` row AND the right patient's name
  (`{TARGET_PATIENT}`), and this run's note must not sit in a wrong-type
  row. Neither arm's self-report is used. This is the hybrid benchmark's
  own check (`verify_hybrid_final`), reused — not a reimplementation.
- **Wrong actions measured for both arms.** The final-state identity
  check flags saves that landed on the wrong patient or wrong encounter
  type, whichever arm produced them.
- **Wall-clock** is measured around the replay / script only (browser
  and server startup excluded for both arms). DOM failures burn
  Playwright's standard 30 s auto-wait timeout before erroring; that
  cost is included, because an unattended script pays it too.
- **$0 and deterministic.** Neither arm makes a model call. MockMed's
  drift hooks are deterministic; OCR on identical frames is
  deterministic. (One known nondeterminism: under `grow`, which template
  rung fires first in the compiled arm is rendering-dependent — both
  safe outcomes are reported as measured.)

## Caveats — read before quoting these numbers

- **This arm only exists on browser backends.** That is not a footnote;
  it is the boundary of the whole comparison, and it cuts both ways. On
  desktop apps, VDI/Citrix, or anything rendered as pixels without an
  inspectable DOM, there is no selector script to write — the incumbent
  comparison is unavailable there, and the vision ladder is the only one
  of the two that runs at all. Conversely, wherever a stable DOM exists,
  the numbers above are the honest baseline the ladder has to beat.
- **MockMed is our own app**, small and clean; its accessibility (proper
  labels, roles) is BETTER than much real-world markup, which flatters
  the DOM arm's selector stability. Real EMRs bury controls in iframes
  and div-soup; both arms would degrade, plausibly at different rates.
- **The drift menu is ours too.** The schedule's three conditions were
  chosen (by the hybrid benchmark) because they halt the compiled arm;
  the perturbation modes come from the validation suite. Neither set was
  chosen to flatter or sabotage the DOM arm — it never ran against any
  of them before this benchmark — but a different drift mix would move
  the totals.
- **n = 1-2 per perturbation cell.** The hooks are deterministic, so
  these are existence results by design, not rates.
- Single machine ({results['platform']}); local server; no network.
