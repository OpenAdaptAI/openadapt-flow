"""EffectBench episode schema — the end-to-end record of one benchmark trial.

This module is the **data contract** the runner adapter and the task pack share.
A benchmark run is a set of :class:`EpisodeRecord` rows; every headline metric
(SWER, over-halt, task success, the success-effect gap) is a pure function of
those rows (see :mod:`.metrics`). Nothing here executes an agent or reads a
system of record — it only *describes* a task and *records* an outcome, so the
schema is import-light (pydantic only) and stable across substrates.

Two authored objects and one recorded object:

- :class:`TaskSpec` — what a task IS (authored once): the goal (natural-language
  intent, never a step list), the substrate, the divergence category, the
  initial system-of-record state, the DECLARED expected effect (a runtime
  :class:`~openadapt_flow.runtime.effects.effect.Effect`), and the
  :class:`OracleSpec` that says how the TRUE effect is read independently of the
  screen.
- :class:`OracleSpec` — a declarative description of the independent oracle
  (which channel, plus the non-gameability attestations the adversarial audit
  checks). The runner materializes it into a concrete
  :class:`~openadapt_flow.runtime.effects.effect.EffectVerifier`.
- :class:`EpisodeRecord` — what HAPPENED on one trial of one task by one arm:
  the agent's self-report, the independent oracle verdict, the classified
  :class:`OutcomeLabel`, and the recorded ``model_calls`` / cost / latency /
  environment fingerprint.

Outcome taxonomy (:class:`OutcomeLabel`) — judged by the independent oracle
crossed with the agent's self-report, never by the screen alone:

======================  =========================================================
label                   meaning
======================  =========================================================
``SUCCESS``             reported success AND exactly one correct, complete effect
                        persisted in the system of record.
``SAFE_HALT``           no effect persisted; the correct action was NOT in fact
                        available (an un-handleable fault) — the desired failure.
``OVER_HALT``           no effect persisted, but the correct action WAS available
                        — recoverable (a human finishes it); annoying, not
                        dangerous. Co-primary metric with SWER.
``SILENT_WRONG_EFFECT`` reported/rendered success while the record is wrong or
                        empty. **The SWER numerator** and the dangerous case.
                        Split by :class:`SwerVariant` into wrong-write vs phantom.
``FALSE_ABORT``         the correct effect persisted but the run reported failure
                        (effect unverified; a naive retry would double-write).
``WRONG_ACTION``        a wrong effect persisted AND the run reported failure — a
                        bad write that is at least not silent.
======================  =========================================================

The distinction from ``benchmark/fault_model``: that study folded a wrong write
made under a *success* report into ``WRONG-ACTION`` and flagged it separately as
``silently_mishandled``. EffectBench makes the headline crisp — **every**
``reported_success AND not oracle_correct`` episode is ``SILENT_WRONG_EFFECT``
(so ``SWER = |SILENT_WRONG_EFFECT| / N`` exactly), and ``WRONG_ACTION`` is
reserved for a wrong write the agent *did* flag (``not reported_success``). The
reference re-expression (:mod:`benchmark.effectbench.reference_fault_model`)
proves the two labelings agree on the fault_model corpus's silent count (5/7).
