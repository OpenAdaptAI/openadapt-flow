"""Frappe Lending Loan Application benchmark contracts and accounting.

This module deliberately contains no environment startup and never calls a
model.  It defines the arm-independent task contract, Frappe REST oracle,
API-control binding, failure taxonomy, and publication gate used by
``scripts/frappe_lending_demo.py``.

The target is a local, synthetic-only Frappe Lending fixture.  A successful
trial creates exactly one ``Loan Application`` for the pinned synthetic
customer with the requested amount and repayment period.  Actor self-report
and pixels are evidence, not the oracle: a read-only Frappe REST session and a
separate SQL delta audit decide the result.
