"""Hybrid benchmark: does compiled-first with agent-fallback-on-halt dominate?

Four arms run the same MockMed triage task over ONE frozen schedule of
clean and drifted conditions (identical condition per slot index across
arms), all judged by the same arm-independent final-state check:

- **compiled** (A): the existing compiled replay. Free. Full schedule.
- **agent** (B): the existing computer-use agent baseline with the
  intent-level task prompt. Paid. Subsample of the schedule.
- **demo_agent** (C): the same agent loop, but the prompt additionally
  includes a compact textual serialization of the recorded demonstration
  (:func:`serialize_demo`). Paid. Same subsample as B.
- **hybrid** (D): run the compiled replay; if it completes, done ($0). If
  it SAFE-HALTS (resolver failure / postcondition drift), hand the SAME
  browser session to a demo-conditioned fallback agent
  (:func:`handoff_task_prompt`) with a smaller action budget. Full
  schedule; pays only on fallbacks.

Drift schedule (frozen in :data:`SCHEDULE`): ~30% of slots carry one of
three MockMed drift conditions chosen — deliberately, and disclosed as
selection bias — because free probe runs showed each makes the CURRENT
compiled bundle safe-halt deterministically while remaining completable at
the intent level:

- ``notice``: a "What's New" interstitial replaces the tasks screen after
  sign-in until dismissed (halts the replay at the Sign In step).
- ``reqfield``: the encounter form gains a required Acuity field; saving
  without it shows an inline validation error (halts at the New Encounter
  step — the form's expected-region postcondition catches the new field
  before anything is typed).
- ``modal-once``: a survey modal intercepts the first save click; after
  dismissing it, saving works (halts at the Save Encounter step).

Probed-but-rejected conditions, reported as findings: ``theme``,
``rename``, ``move``, and a Triage->"Triage Assessment" relabel+reorder
(``typelabel``) are all absorbed by the resolution ladder (the replay
heals and completes correctly), so they cannot exercise the fallback.

Success, implemented once for ALL arms (:func:`verify_hybrid_final`):
OCR of the final screenshot must show the saved-encounter evidence
(banner + ``Triage — <note>`` row), the RIGHT patient, and no wrong-type
write. This is deliberately stricter than the earlier MockMed benchmark:
the validation suite (PR #12) documents silent wrong-action modes in the
replayer, so success here checks final-state identity, not just the
run's own flags.

Hard cost guardrails, shared across ALL paid arms (B, C, and D's
fallbacks) via one :class:`SpendLedger`: preflight probe before any
spend, a per-run cap (default $1.50 at list price), a TOTAL ceiling
(default $8.00 at list price) enforced before every paid run,
consecutive-billing-error abort, and incremental per-run persistence to
``out_dir/rows.jsonl``.

Target: MockMed (the demo clinic app bundled in this repo; fake data only,
local, free, unlimited).

**Task**: sign in as `nurse.demo`, open the first referral, create a New
Encounter of type Triage, enter a parameterized note (distinct per arm and
slot), save.

**Thesis under test**: under a realistic mix of clean and drifted UI
conditions, "compiled-first with agent-fallback-on-halt" (hybrid) matches
agent-only reliability at a fraction of agent-only cost.

## The drift schedule (designed before spending)

{len(sched['conditions'])} slots, {n_drift} drifted
({sched['drift_fraction']:.0%}), frozen before any paid run. Arms A and D
run all slots; arms B and C run the {len(sched['agent_slots'])}-slot
subsample {sched['agent_slots']} (5 clean + one of each drift type).
Every arm sees the identical condition at the same slot index.
{mix_note}
| condition | what changes | compiled halt point (probed free, 3/3 deterministic) | intent-level recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| `notice` | a "What's New" interstitial replaces the tasks screen after sign-in until dismissed | Sign In click (postcondition: tasks screen never appears) | click "Continue to tasks" |
| `reqfield` | the encounter form gains a required Acuity field; saving without it shows a validation error | New Encounter click (postcondition: form region changed) — halts BEFORE anything is typed | select an acuity, then save |
| `modal-once` | a survey modal intercepts the FIRST save click; after dismissal saving works | Save Encounter click (postcondition: saved banner never appears) | dismiss the modal, save again |

Conditions probed and REJECTED because the compiled arm absorbs them
(the resolution ladder heals through and the run completes correctly —
verified against final-state identity, not just the run's own flags):
`theme` (dark palette; 8 heals), `rename` (button relabels; 2 heals),
`move` (relocated buttons; 2 heals), and `typelabel` (Triage segment
relabeled "Triage Assessment" AND segment order swapped; healed via the
OCR rung and saved the correct Triage encounter for the correct patient,
3/3). Drift that a compiled replay heals through cannot exercise the
fallback; only drift it HALTS on can.

## Sensitivity: the 30% drift mix is an assumption

Let `d` = the fraction of runs that hit compiled-halting drift, `f` = the
mean fallback cost per halted run (measured here:
${mean_fb_cost:.4f}), and `a` = the agent-only mean cost per run
(measured here: ${agent_cpr:.4f}). Expected hybrid model cost per run is
`d x f` (clean runs are $0) versus `a` for agent-only:

- at `d = 0` (no drift): hybrid cost is $0 per run;
- at `d = 1` (every run drifts): hybrid cost approaches `f` per run plus
  the halt-detection wall-clock overhead (~5-10 s of postcondition
  timeout per halt here);
- break-even: hybrid is cheaper than agent-only whenever `d x f < a`,
  i.e. for every `d` up to `a / f`{f" = {breakeven:.1f}" if breakeven is not None else ""}.
  When `f <= a` (a mid-workflow fallback is no dearer than a full agent
  run), the hybrid is cheaper at EVERY drift rate.

## Methodology

- **Record + compile once.** The demo is recorded via the Playwright demo
  driver and compiled into a vision-anchored bundle; recording/compiling
  is a one-time cost excluded from per-run latency (same as the earlier
  benchmarks).
- **Identical environments.** Every run of every arm gets a fresh
  chromium browser + page against the same locally served MockMed app
  (state lives in the page). Drift is injected via MockMed's `?drift=`
  query flags, so conditions are exactly reproducible.
- **Same interface.** All arms drive the same `PlaywrightBackend`,
  vision-only: screenshots in; pixel clicks, typed text, key presses out.
- **Agent arms.** Model `{results['model']}` with the
  `{results['computer_tool']}` computer-use tool (beta header
  `{results['beta_header']}`), prompt caching on, history bounded to the
  last 3 screenshots, {results['agent_max_actions']}-action budget (B, C)
  and {results['fallback_max_actions']}-action budget for D's mid-workflow
  fallback. Arm B's prompt states user intent only. Arm C's prompt = B's
  plus the serialized demonstration (action type + human-readable target
  per step, `<note>` placeholder, NO coordinates). D's fallback prompt =
  intent + serialized demo + "steps 1..k reported complete, halted at
  step k+1 because <reason>", continuing in the replayer's own browser
  session.
- **Same success criterion, implemented once.** `verify_hybrid_final` on
  the final screenshot: OCR must find the `Encounter saved` banner AND
  the `Triage — <note>` row AND the right patient's name, and this run's
  note must not appear in a wrong-type row. No arm's self-report is used.
- **Distinct note per (arm, slot)** so a pass proves parameter
  substitution against the run's own value.
- **Cost** from API `usage` token counts at list pricing
  (${results['pricing_usd_per_mtok']['input']:.2f} /
  ${results['pricing_usd_per_mtok']['output']:.2f} per MTok in/out;
  cache writes 1.25x, cache reads 0.1x input). An introductory $2/$10
  rate applies through 2026-08-31, so billed cost today is roughly a
  third lower than reported.
{identity_block}
- **Hard cost guardrails.** One shared budget across ALL paid runs (B, C,
  and D's fallbacks): preflight probe before any spend; per-run cap
  ${caps['per_run']:.2f}; total ceiling ${caps['total']:.2f} enforced
  before every paid run (trips are disclosed, never raised); two
  consecutive auth/billing errors abort paid spending; every finished run
  appends to `rows.jsonl`. Total recorded spend at list price:
  **${caps['total_spent_list']:.2f}**.

## Caveats — read before quoting these numbers

- **The hybrid's reliability is bounded by halt-DETECTION reliability.**
  Fallback fires only on DETECTED halts. The validation suite
  (`docs/validation/VALIDATION.md` on `feat/validation-suite`, PR #12)
  documents silent wrong-action modes in the compiled replayer —
  lookalike/imposter rows clicked with high template confidence, deleted
  targets resolving to a neighbouring row, rows inserted above shifting
  the target, and focus theft silently dropping typed text — which
  produce a green report with a wrong or empty write and would BYPASS the
  hybrid's fallback entirely. The dominance claim, to whatever extent
  supported above, applies ONLY to detected-halt drift. This benchmark's
  success check verifies final-state identity (right patient, right
  type, the run's own note) precisely because the replayer's self-report
  is not sufficient.
- **Selection bias in the drift conditions, by construction.** The three
  drift conditions were chosen BECAUSE free probe runs showed they make
  the current bundle safe-halt deterministically (and remain completable
  at the intent level). Drift that the ladder absorbs (theme, renames,
  moves) is under-represented — on such drift the hybrid is identical to
  the compiled arm at $0. Real-world drift mixes will contain all three
  classes (absorbed / detected-halt / silent-wrong) in unknown
  proportions.
- **MockMed is our own app**, built simple and high-contrast; both the
  drift hooks and the workflow are synthetic. Treat this as a controlled
  experiment on the ORCHESTRATION policy, not a field result.
- **Small agent Ns** ({b['n']} per paid arm; {d.get('fallback_count', 0)}
  hybrid fallbacks): success rates carry wide error bars; single-run
  differences are within noise.
- **The 30% drift fraction is an assumption** — see the sensitivity note
  and break-even formula above.
- **The compiled arm needs a demonstration first** (about a minute of
  human demonstration, one-time). The agent arms need only the prompt;
  arm C and D's fallback also consume the demonstration, serialized.
- **Model version pinned**: `{results['model']}` with
  `{results['computer_tool']}` on {date}.
- Single machine ({results['platform']}); local server; no network
  variance except the Anthropic API round trips in paid runs.

## Reproduce

```
.venv/bin/python -m openadapt_flow.benchmark.hybrid_benchmark --out benchmark/hybrid
```

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `~/.anthropic/api_key`). The paid arms
cost real money (${caps['total_spent_list']:.2f} at list price when this
was generated; billed cost is lower under the intro rate). The compiled
arm and the drift probes are free.
