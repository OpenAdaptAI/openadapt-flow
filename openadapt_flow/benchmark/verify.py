"""Arm-independent success criteria for the benchmarks.

Both arms — compiled replay and the computer-use agent — are judged by the
exact same check, applied to a screenshot of the final state. Neither arm's
internal notion of success (the replayer's ``RunReport.success``, the
agent's own claim of completion) is used.

Two checks live here, one per benchmark target:

- :func:`verify_encounter_saved` (MockMed): OCR must find (a) the
  ``Encounter saved — <note>`` banner and (b) the saved encounter row
  (``<type> — <note>``). MockMed renders both only on the patient screen
  after a successful save, so the check passes only in the
  navigated-back-to-patient state a user would accept as "done".
- :func:`verify_note_saved` (OpenEMR): OCR of the final screen must show
  the run's parameterized note text in the patient-message list.

    The message list embeds the note inside a longer line (``<timestamp>

    misses; and rapidocr drops some dense table lines entirely at
    1280x800, so when the raw frame does not pass, the frame is retried
    at 2x resolution, which recovers most dropped lines.

    The criterion is a **contiguous** matched run of at least ``min_run``
    squashed characters between the note and the frame's OCR text. A
    non-contiguous matched-character fraction is deliberately NOT a
    criterion: on a dense screen full of similar English text, scattered
    subsequence matches accumulate past any sane threshold for notes that
    are not on screen at all (measured 0.9+ for absent notes), while
    contiguous runs separate cleanly (>=29 for present notes vs <=8 for
    absent ones on audited frames). Callers must use note texts whose
    pairwise longest common squashed substring stays below ``min_run`` —
    several runs' notes are visible on the same final screen.
