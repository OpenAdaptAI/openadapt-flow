"""Bundle schema v2: manifest/provenance, content digest, and load-time
structural + integrity validation.

A compiled bundle is the trust boundary between the demonstration compiler and
the deterministic replayer: everything the replayer will do to a real system of
record is frozen in ``workflow.json`` (+ its template PNGs). Historically that
artifact was raw JSON with a ``schema_version`` stuck at 1, no migration path,
no manifest, no content hashes, and -- most importantly -- NO structural
validation on load. A malformed or tampered graph would only surface as a
confusing runtime failure (or, worse, a silent wrong action).

This module closes those gaps additively (it never rewrites an existing
bundle's semantics):

* **Manifest / provenance** (:class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.BundleManifest`):
  per-file SHA-256 hashes of the template/image assets, a whole-bundle
  ``content_digest``, the compiler version that produced the bundle, and -- for
  a certified bundle -- the policy it was certified against, its certification
  status, and an optional expiry.
* **Migration** (:func:`migrate_bundle_dict`): a v1 bundle (or one with no
  ``schema_version``) migrates cleanly to v2 in memory on read. v2 is a strict
  superset of v1, so migration only stamps the new version and back-fills the
  manifest if it is absent -- an existing bundle keeps replaying byte-for-byte.
* **Load-time structural validation** (:func:`validate_workflow`): reject a
  malformed or uncertifiable graph with clear, per-issue errors BEFORE the
  replayer touches it. Rules span graph well-formedness (entry exists, every
  transition target resolves, each state's kind matches its payload, referenced
  subflows exist, ids are unique, terminals are reachable, no unsafe
  unconditional cycle) and the ONE safety rule that motivates all the rest:
  every path that reaches a consequential/irreversible action also reaches its
  effect verification.
* **Integrity** (:func:`verify_integrity`): recompute the digest on load and
  refuse a bundle whose ``workflow.json`` or assets were tampered with after
  the manifest was sealed.

Everything here is import-light (stdlib + pydantic + the IR); it brings in no
OCR / cv2 / model dependencies, so it is safe to call on every load.
