    When ``bundle`` and ``step_id`` are given, the REGION_STABLE
    postcondition also carries a template crop of the expected region
    content (``templates/<step_id>_expect.png``): real apps re-layout by a
    few pixels between runs (auto-scrolling panes, banner heights), which a
    fixed-position phash cannot tolerate — the replayer first looks for the
    expected content NEAR the recorded region and only then falls back to
    the exact-position hash.

    ``include_region_stable=False`` skips the diff-based REGION_STABLE
    entirely: for parameterized TYPE steps the changed region IS the typed
    value's pixels, and the value varies per run — asserting its rendering
    is the pixel-level equivalent of asserting the excluded text.

    ``next_before_png`` / ``next_lines`` — the NEXT event's before frame
    (the same screen state captured moments later) and its OCR — arm the
    empirical stability checks: a REGION_STABLE region that already changed
    between the two captures (animations, clocks, fading toasts) is
    self-mutating and is not asserted, and TEXT_PRESENT candidates must
    persist into the later capture.

    ``before_lines`` / ``after_lines`` let the caller supply cached OCR;
    when omitted the frames are OCRed here.

    remote-display/pixel replays, with every crop-less identity-applicable
    step recording WHY in ``Step.identifier_crop_missing_reason`` (see
    :func:`_emit_identifier_crop`) — and derive postconditions
    (REGION_STABLE on the largest changed region plus TEXT_PRESENT for the
    most STABLE new text — volatile candidates such as clock fragments,
    near dates and counters are rejected, and candidates must persist into
    the next frame; see :mod:`openadapt_flow.volatility`). Steps that mined
    nothing fall back to structural postconditions (URL/title change, new
    tab) when the recorder captured them. Type/key events carry
    their text/param/key through. Parameterized typed values and click
    target labels are never asserted in any step's postconditions (the
    former vary per run; the latter are mutable evidence the resolution
    ladder heals through under rename drift), and a final lint fails
    compilation if a demo parameter value leaked into any postcondition or
    geometry landmark. The bundle gets ``workflow.json``,
    ``templates/*.png`` and a generated readable ``workflow.py``.

    Risk is AUTO-CLASSIFIED: each CLICK/DOUBLE_CLICK step whose intent or
    button label is write-shaped (create/update/delete/submit/save/confirm
    ...) compiles as ``risk="irreversible"`` (see :mod:`openadapt_flow.risk`);
    everything else is ``"reversible"``. ``risk_overrides`` still wins, in
    either direction. Irreversible steps refuse to act when they only resolve
    below the OCR rung or when their identity band is unreadable (see
    :class:`~openadapt_flow.runtime.Replayer`), so this arms those safeguards
    by default for consequential writes instead of only when a human marks a
    step. The classifier leans irreversible when unsure on a write-shaped step
    (the safe direction; false-positive posture documented in the module).

    Args:
        recording_dir: Recording directory (meta.json, events.jsonl, frames/).
        out_bundle_dir: Output bundle directory (created if missing).
        name: Workflow name.
        risk_overrides: Optional ``{step_id: risk}`` map (step ids are
            positional: ``step_000`` is the first recorded event). Values
            must be ``"reversible"`` or ``"irreversible"``.
        mine_effects: Opt-in system-of-record effect mining
            (``compiler.effect_mining``). When True, each step gets candidate
            typed ``Effect``s auto-derived from what the demonstration observed:
            a real ``record_written`` / ``field_equals`` from a captured
            ``/api/db``-style SoR delta, a flagged placeholder for a
            consequential step whose binding is app-specific (not derivable),
            or nothing (with an honest "no verifiable effect derivable" log).
            Default False keeps the bundle byte-identical to before; even when
            True a bundle is unchanged wherever mining derives nothing.
        annotate: Opt-in COMPILE-TIME model annotation
            (``compiler.annotate``). When True, a :class:`StepAnnotator` proposes
            richer step LABELS, RISK refinements, and typed PARAMETER inferences
            over the compiled workflow, and its proposals are applied with the
            confirm-don't-trust asymmetry: a risk UPGRADE (reversible ->
            irreversible) and a pure parameter TYPE enrichment are applied; a
            risk DOWNGRADE or a consequential parameter inference is FLAGGED for
            an operator, never applied. Applied risk upgrades land in
            ``step.risk``; the full proposal/flag audit trail is written to a
            bundle sidecar ``annotations.json``. This is COMPILE-TIME ONLY -- the
            replayer never reads it and makes ZERO model calls. Default False
            keeps the bundle byte-identical to today (heuristic only, no model,
            no key needed).
        annotator: The :class:`StepAnnotator` to use when ``annotate`` is True.
            None defaults to :class:`~openadapt_flow.compiler.annotate.
            AnthropicStepAnnotator` (the real model, resolved lazily -- it needs
            an API key only when it actually runs). Tests pass a network-free
            fake. Ignored when ``annotate`` is False.
