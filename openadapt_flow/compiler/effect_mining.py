"""Auto-derive system-of-record ``Effect`` specs from a demonstration.

The compiler already mines *vision* postconditions (``compile._postconditions``)
and *structural* ones (URL/title/new-tab). It does NOT, on its own, produce the
typed ``Effect`` contracts (``record_written`` / ``field_equals``) that the
``EffectVerifier`` checks against the REAL system of record — those have been
hand-authored per workflow (see ``benchmark/silent_wrong_action._effect_verify``
and every ``tests/test_effect_*``). Both external reviews flagged exactly this:

    "the compiler emits Postconditions; auto-deriving the system-of-record
     binding (which field/endpoint maps to which step) is the missing piece."

This module closes that gap *honestly*, respecting the boundary the RFC draws
in ``docs/design/WORKFLOW_PROGRAM_IR.md`` §7:

- **Derivable now** — when the demonstration actually OBSERVED the system of
  record (a ``/api/db``-style JSON snapshot captured before and after a step,
  or a structured DOM field map), the concrete binding *is* in the recording:
  which record appeared, which field took the typed value, and (if present)
  the idempotency key. We mine those into real, machine-checkable ``Effect``s.

- **Not derivable — "irreducibly app-specific"** (§7) — when a step is a
  consequential write but the demonstration captured NO system-of-record
  observation, *which* API / record / idempotency-key the write maps to is
  customer-specific and simply is not in the recording. We refuse to INVENT an
  endpoint: we emit a clearly-flagged PLACEHOLDER effect
  (:attr:`Effect.needs_operator_confirmation`) that a run will not silently
  trust, and log the gap.

- **No signal at all** — a step with no observed SoR delta that is not marked
  consequential gets NO effect and an honest "no verifiable effect derivable"
  log line (never a fabricated green).

The miner makes ZERO model / network calls — it is pure heuristics over what
the demonstration already recorded (the compile-time $0 guarantee; a model at
compile time is a separate, later item).

Where the demonstration's SoR snapshots come from
-------------------------------------------------
The recorder attaches a snapshot of the system of record to each event when
the recording backend exposes one (``backend.SystemOfRecordBackend`` →
``recorder`` writes ``sor_before`` / ``sor_after`` on the event, exactly as it
already does for ``url_before`` / ``url_after``). A structured DOM field map,
when a backend captures one, arrives as ``dom_fields_before`` /
``dom_fields_after``. Backends that expose neither (pixel-only substrates)
simply never populate them, and the miner falls back to the honest placeholder
/ no-effect paths above.
