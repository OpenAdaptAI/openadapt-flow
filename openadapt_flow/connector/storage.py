"""Customer-owned storage — the BYOC PHI boundary on the DATA side.

For a BYOC job the PHI-bearing bytes (the compiled bundle IN, the run report
OUT) live in the CUSTOMER'S OWN storage, never ours. The control-plane job
descriptor carries only opaque relative KEYS (``storage.bundle_ref`` /
``storage.report_ref``); the Connector resolves them against the storage it is
configured with. Our control plane holds NO URL to these bytes and signs NO
access to them.

This module ships the two backends the core loop needs:

* :class:`LocalCustomerStorage` — REAL: refs resolve under a customer directory
  (ideally a full-disk-encrypted volume). The on-prem clinic posture.
* :class:`InMemoryCustomerStorage` — tests/dry-run: stages exact archive bytes
  and CAPTURES the report in memory, proving the report bytes never leave for
  the control plane, with zero infra.

S3 / Azure Blob backends are documented as production follow-ups (they need a
customer cloud to exercise); the operator reference agent in openadapt-cloud
(``connector/agent.py``) already carries them.
