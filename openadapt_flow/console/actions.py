"""Governance actions for the console: EXISTING verbs only, shown-then-run.

Every action here is one of the engine's existing entry points -- the
``openadapt-flow`` CLI verbs (``approve`` / ``resume`` / ``certify`` /
``teach``) or the skill library's governed ``promote`` / ``quarantine``
(:class:`openadapt_flow.learning.library.SkillLibrary`). The console adds NO
new engine semantics: it renders the exact command an action will run, and --
only when the server was started with ``--allow-actions`` -- executes that
same command (a CLI subprocess, or the same library call the CLI path uses).

``teach`` is deliberately RENDER-ONLY: it needs a fix demonstration the
operator must record, so the console shows the exact command to copy instead
of faking an execution path that cannot exist.
