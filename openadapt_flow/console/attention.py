"""Redacted, local-only projections for the staff attended halt queue.

The queue deliberately does not expose workflow names, parameters, halt
reasons, observed text, local paths, or raw report/checkpoint payloads.  It
returns opaque run ids, category-derived operator copy, counts, timestamps,
and existing opaque screenshot ids.  Protected screenshots remain behind the
console's authenticated, symlink-safe artifact endpoint.

This module remains projection-only.  Engine-owned attended mutations live in
``runtime.durable.attended`` and appear only when an exact pause capability and
deployment-bound action service are present.
