"""The part of a halt that CAN cross a third-party relay, proved field by field.

``openadapt_flow.console.halt_detail`` already answers "what broke, what was
tried, and what a continuation re-proves" in a closed vocabulary — typed halt
category, step ordinal, action kind, control role, per-rung verdicts, and the
list of contracts the engine re-checks. It is currently returned only inside the
**local** ``presentation`` block, and
``human_decisions.portable_remote_decision_task`` discards it wholesale.

That wholesale discard was a boundary drawn around the *block*, not around its
*fields*. The block contains exactly one field that is not a closed enum, a
bounded integer, or a boolean: ``target_label``, the target control's own
accessible name, released by ``halt_detail._safe_target_label`` only after six
independent proofs. That single string is why the whole block stayed local.

This module re-derives the block **without it**. :class:`RemoteHaltContextV1`
has no string-valued field at all — every value is drawn from a closed
vocabulary pinned to the engine's own literals, a bounded integer, or a
boolean. A relay that stores this object is structurally incapable of
representing a patient name, an MRN, an observed value, a path, or a workflow
label, in precisely the same sense as
:class:`~openadapt_types.HumanDecisionTaskV1`. The claim is checkable by reading
the schema rather than by trusting a detector.

What the operator loses at this tier is one adjective: the phone says "OpenAdapt
could not find the button" instead of "the button labelled 'Open'". The label
stays available at :attr:`~openadapt_flow.decision_delivery.DecisionDeliveryTier.LOCAL_FULL`,
which is the boundary that already serves protected screenshot crops.

Fail-closed, in both directions
-------------------------------

Projection is a re-validation, never a copy. Every value is re-checked against
the closed vocabulary here even though ``halt_detail`` produced it, so a future
change there cannot silently widen what leaves the runner: an unrecognised
value is dropped to ``None`` (or the row is dropped), and a structurally
unusable block yields ``None`` rather than a partial object. Pydantic's
``extra="forbid"`` then refuses any key this module did not name.
