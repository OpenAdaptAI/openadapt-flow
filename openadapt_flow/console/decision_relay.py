"""Reach a phone without opening a port: the runner dials out.

Before this module the two attended-decision delivery paths were:

* the **runner-local portal** — full fidelity, protected screenshot crops, the
  gated control label — reachable from a phone only through an HTTPS ingress
  the customer terminates themselves; and
* the **hosted control plane** — reachable from anywhere, but with nothing on
  the runner that ever spoke to it. The hosted endpoints existed; no client did.

A dental practice will not stand up a reverse proxy, so the first path is not
available to them, and the second was not wired. This module wires it, in the
only shape that needs nothing from the customer's network: the runner makes
**outbound HTTPS requests only** — no inbound port, no port forward, no
certificate, no static address, works behind NAT — following the same
``register -> poll -> lease -> ack`` shape ``openadapt-desktop``'s runner lane
already uses for governed runs.

What crosses, and what does not
-------------------------------

Exactly the :class:`~openadapt_flow.console.human_decisions.RemoteDecisionProjection`
the engine already builds: the signed PHI-free task, and — at
``remote_closed_context`` — the closed-vocabulary
:class:`~openadapt_flow.console.decision_context.RemoteHaltContextV1`. No
screenshot, no OCR text, no observed value, no path, no workflow label, and no
free-text field of any kind. The hosted service is not trusted with protected
content; it is structurally incapable of receiving it.

What a returned decision is, and is not
---------------------------------------

A relayed answer is **presentation and authentication evidence, never execution
authority**. It is admitted through the same
:func:`~openadapt_flow.console.human_decisions.execute_remote_attended_action`
path a directly-connected AAL2 surface uses: the exact pause capability is
re-checked, a single-flight lease is taken, the live application is re-read, and
every contract in ``will_recheck`` is re-proved before anything continues. A tap
on a phone is not a verified business effect and this module cannot make it one.

Uncertainty is reported, never guessed
--------------------------------------

Two boundaries here can fail after a request may already have taken effect, and
both are classified rather than retried:

* :meth:`DecisionRelay.publish` returns
  :attr:`PublishState.UNKNOWN` when a POST left the process without a terminal
  response. The task may or may not be visible on a phone. The caller is told
  ``unknown`` and the local console remains the authoritative surface; nothing
  re-POSTs on the assumption that the first attempt failed.
* :meth:`DecisionRelay.acknowledge` has the same property in the other
  direction. A decision that was executed locally but whose acknowledgement did
  not land stays leased server-side and is re-delivered; the engine's existing
  idempotency key makes the replay a no-op rather than a second execution.

**"Delivered" is not claimed anywhere in this module.** A successful POST proves
the control plane accepted the task, not that a person received or read it.
:class:`PublishOutcome` says ``published``; nothing in this file says
``delivered``, because the runner cannot observe that.
