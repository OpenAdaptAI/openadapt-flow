"""Demo driver: records the canonical MockMed triage demonstration.

Record time is allowed to cheat with Playwright locators (to find pixel
coordinates via ``bounding_box()``), but every action is performed through
`Recorder` so frames and events are captured exactly as a human demo would
be. Replay never uses selectors.
