"""Continuous skill learning: a versioned, GOVERNED learn/promote loop.

The review's item 7 -- "cluster successful and failed traces, update the inferred
state machine, test candidate revisions on held-out executions, and promote only
verified versions" -- assembled as ORCHESTRATION over parts that already exist:

- the Phase-2 :class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.ProgramGraph` state machine (the thing
  learned), replayed for coverage by a symbolic ``$0`` interpreter
  (:mod:`openadapt_flow.learning.interpreter`);
- PR #70's promotion posture -- a deterministic regression GATE (identity /
  effect / risk may not regress) then a CANARY -- lifted from one heal patch to a
  whole program revision (:mod:`openadapt_flow.learning.gate`,
  :mod:`openadapt_flow.learning.loop`);
- a versioned, persistent :class:`~openadapt_flow.learning.library.SkillLibrary`
  that keeps every revision's provenance and status, never silently adopting an
  unverified one.

Multi-trace INDUCTION (turning traces into a revised graph) is a sibling PR,
depended on only through the :class:`~openadapt_flow.learning.loop.Inducer`
Protocol; :mod:`openadapt_flow.learning.synth_stream` provides a synthetic
drift-stream harness and a deterministic reference inducer to exercise the loop.

No model calls anywhere on the runtime path.
