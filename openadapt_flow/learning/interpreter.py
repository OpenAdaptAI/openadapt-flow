"""Symbolic Phase-2 coverage check: does a ``ProgramGraph`` REPRODUCE a trace?

The continuous-learning loop must answer "does the current active program still
explain the executions we just saw?" without a live app. This module walks a
:class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.ProgramGraph` deterministically over an
:class:`~openadapt_flow.learning.trace.ExecutionTrace`'s observed facts -- the
SAME control-flow rules the live Phase-2 interpreter in
:mod:`openadapt_flow.runtime.replayer` applies (guarded transitions evaluated in
order, first match wins; a guarded ``skip`` step is a no-op when its predicate
is unmet; loops bounded by ``max_iterations``) -- but instead of resolving pixels
it consumes the trace's ordered action intents and evaluates predicates against
the trace's recorded ``facts`` / ``params``.

A graph REPRODUCES a successful trace iff the walk consumes EXACTLY the trace's
observed actions, in order, and reaches a ``success`` terminal (or falls off the
graph cleanly). Anything else -- a leftover unconsumed action (the trace did
something the program has no state for), an action-state intent that does not
match, a branch with no matching edge, a ``halt`` terminal -- is a coverage GAP.

Deterministic and ``$0``: no pixels, no backend, no model calls. This is the
"replay via the Phase-2 interpreter" the design calls for, at the structural
altitude a trace stream lives at.
