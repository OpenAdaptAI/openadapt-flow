"""Synthetic trace-stream harness: a MockMed skill drifting over "time".

To exercise the learn/promote loop end-to-end without a live app, this module

1. builds a base MockMed skill program (``add-patient-note`` from
   ``docs/design/WORKFLOW_PROGRAM_IR.md`` section 2.5: sign in -> open the
   patient record -> new encounter -> type note -> SAVE), and
2. emits a STREAM of :class:`~openadapt_flow.learning.trace.ExecutionTrace`s over
   a logical time axis with INJECTED DRIFT at a chosen trace index -- e.g. a new
   consent dialog starts appearing mid-stream, so the active program stops
   reproducing the new successful traces and the loop must detect the novelty,
   induce a revision, validate it, and promote it.

It also provides :class:`StructuralDiffInducer`, a deterministic, model-free
REFERENCE inducer used by the harness/tests. It is a stand-in for the real
multi-trace-induction sibling PR (wired in at merge via the
:class:`~openadapt_flow.learning.loop.Inducer` Protocol): it induces exactly the
"a new optional step appeared" revision -- detect an intent present in some
successful traces but absent from the base program, and splice it in as a
GUARDED optional step (a Phase-1 ``skip`` guard keyed on the screen fact that
co-occurs with it). It does NOT invent identity/effect/risk -- a dialog
dismissal is reversible and unarmed -- so the regression gate has nothing to
refuse on the happy path, exactly as intended.

All deterministic, ``$0``, no model calls.
