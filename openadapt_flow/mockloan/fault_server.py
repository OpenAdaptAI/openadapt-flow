"""Transactional fault-injection server for the MockLoan demo app.

The bundled MockLoan app (``mockloan/static``) is a purely client-side SPA: an
"authorize" mutates an in-page JavaScript object, so the UI *is* the source of
truth and there is nothing to verify a write against. Real record systems have
a persistence boundary - a loan-servicing core a disbursement must actually
reach - and the dangerous failures for *consequential writes* (moving money to
a borrower) live at that boundary: partial saves, duplicate submissions,
commit-then-timeout, optimistic-UI success the core later rejects, session
expiry, and lost updates from a concurrent modification (a fraud hold).

This server adds that boundary WITHOUT changing the normal benchmark. It serves
the exact same static files (so recorded template crops and mined postconditions
are unchanged) and adds a small JSON API that the app talks to *only* when the
page is loaded with ``?fault=<mode>`` (a flag-gated hook that mirrors the
existing ``?drift=`` hooks). With no ``?fault`` query the app never calls the
API and behaves byte-for-byte as before.

The server keeps an in-process "ledger" (a list of disbursement records) that is
the independent GROUND TRUTH: the fault-model study judges each replay by what
actually landed in this store via ``GET /api/db`` - never by the replay's own
vision-based self-report.

Fault modes (selected by ``?fault=`` on the write POST, forwarded by the app):

- ``ok``          -- control: the disbursement is booked normally.
- ``partial``     -- the row is booked but the funding memo is dropped
                     (core only saved some fields). UI still says "authorized".
- ``optimistic``  -- the core REJECTS the write; the app already painted a
                     success banner optimistically, so the screen lies.
- ``timeout``     -- the core BOOKS the row, then hangs past the client
                     timeout; the app sees an error though the money moved.
- ``session``     -- the write returns 401 (session expired); nothing is booked
                     and the app bounces to the login screen.
- ``stale``       -- last-write-wins over a loan a concurrent officer changed
                     between record and replay: the other change (a fraud hold)
                     is lost.
- ``duplicate`` / ``double`` -- the write is accepted every time it arrives;
                     a double-submit / double-delivered click books TWO
                     disbursements (the borrower is paid twice).
- ``idempotent``  -- like ``duplicate`` but the app sends an idempotency key
                     and the core de-duplicates on it (the RECOMMENDED fix).
- ``collateral``  -- the CORRECT disbursement to the target loan is booked (the
                     disbursements ledger looks perfect), but a spurious
                     money-movement (an unauthorized servicing fee referencing
                     the same loan and funding memo) is ALSO written to a
                     SEPARATE fees / general-ledger surface. This is the lending
                     analog of the clinical ``collateral_unaudited`` fault (a
                     correct encounter plus a stray billing row). A
                     disbursements-only oracle certifies the write; only a
                     COMPLETE read path spanning both ledgers sees the extra row.

The ledger records two surfaces: ``disbursements`` (the money paid out to the
borrower) and ``fees`` (a general-ledger / charges surface). A record carries a
``surface`` field (default ``"disbursements"``). Two read paths expose them:

- ``GET /api/disbursements`` -- the SINGLE-surface read path: only the
  disbursements ledger. A single out-of-band oracle over this path is blind to a
  fees-surface write (the lending analog of the clinical single-surface REST
  oracle over encounters only).
- ``GET /api/db`` -- the COMPLETE read path: every mutable surface. The full
  read path an effect oracle needs to reach 0 residual.

A ``DELETE /api/disbursement/<id>`` route (additive; never used by a ``?fault=``
path) lets an EffectVerifier compensation hook reconcile a detected duplicate
against this same system of record.

All data is fake. Nothing here touches the network beyond localhost.
