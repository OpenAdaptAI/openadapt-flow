"""The local Run Receipt: a shareable artifact built from an ALLOW-LIST.

A run's ``REPORT.md`` is the operator's artifact and is deliberately rich: it
embeds a before/after screenshot per step, the plaintext values that were
typed, the OCR text harvested for identity checks, resolved coordinates, and
the run's parameters.  Every one of those is a PHI or secret carrier.  Sharing
one from a live system of record is a reportable breach, which is exactly what
:class:`openadapt_flow.privacy.PlaintextPHIWarning` warns about.

Therefore the shareable artifact is **generated additively from a closed
allow-list, never redacted subtractively from the operator artifact.**
Subtractive redaction of a run report is unwinnable: burned-in pixels, OCR text
that was captured *precisely because* it identifies a record, and free-form
halt reasons all leak, and one missed field is a breach.

The shape follows the reviewed precedent already shipped in
``openadapt-types`` 0.6.0's portable human-decision contract, which permits only
closed enums, counts, digests, opaque identifiers, expiry, and allowed actions,
with no screenshot, OCR text, raw value, or free-form field.

Nothing outside :class:`RunReceipt` may serialize.  The model is
``extra="forbid"``, so an unknown key is REFUSED rather than silently dropped,
and every field is either a closed enum, a bounded count, a digest, or a
strictly validated package version. There is no operator-supplied text field.

Explicitly forbidden and structurally unrepresentable here: screenshots, OCR
text, typed values, parameters, URLs, hostnames, coordinates, application name,
organization name, user name, workflow name, step intents, and halt free text.

The receipt is a LOCAL file.  Nothing in this module performs network I/O.
