"""Compile-time risk classification.

Heuristically infers whether a compiled :class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.Step`
performs a CONSEQUENTIAL, hard-to-undo write (``risk="irreversible"``) versus
a benign, repeatable action (``risk="reversible"``), from the step's intent and
its target's label / OCR text.

Why this exists
---------------
Historically every step compiled as ``reversible`` unless a human passed
``risk_overrides`` (see ``docs/LIMITS.md`` — "Risk classification is opt-in and
never auto-assigned"). That left the irreversible-step safeguards
(below-OCR-rung refusal, unreadable-identity-band refusal in
:class:`~openadapt_flow.runtime.Replayer`) UNREACHABLE from a default compile —
so a wrong-patient write behind an unreadable identity band proceeded with a
green report. This classifier turns those safeguards ON by default for
write-shaped steps. ``risk_overrides`` still wins (an operator can always force
a step either way).

Heuristic
---------
Only actuating CLICK / DOUBLE_CLICK steps can classify irreversible (they are
the actuators that commit a write; typing into a field and scrolling are
reversible, and a bare key press is not a reliable write signal). The step's
``intent`` and its anchor's ``ocr_text`` (the button label) are scanned for a
consequential-write verb — create / update / delete / submit / save / confirm
and their siblings — matched on WORD boundaries so ``address`` does not trip
``add`` and ``postal`` does not trip ``post``.

False-positive posture
----------------------
DELIBERATELY biased toward ``irreversible`` on write-shaped steps. A false
irreversible costs AVAILABILITY (an over-strict refusal, or a ``certify``
failure a human must clear); a false reversible costs SAFETY (a wrong,
unguarded write reported as success). We take the cheap error. Concretely,
labels like "Apply filter" or "Add to favourites" classify irreversible even
though they are cheap to undo — the safe direction. Known under-classifications
we accept (leaning benign): bare "Cancel" (usually a dialog abort, occasionally
"cancel subscription"), "Next"/"Continue" wizard steps (the final one may
submit), and a submitting Enter key press. Mark those with ``risk_overrides``
when they matter.
