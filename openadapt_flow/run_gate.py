"""Fail-closed admission gate for regulated execution (``openadapt-flow run``).

``replay`` is the permissive DEMO path: it will drive a bundle against an app
with every safety control (certification, identity arming, effect verification,
encryption) left OPTIONAL, because a demo's job is to *show the mechanism*, not
to be safe. The external safety review scored that default posture 4/10 for
exactly this reason: nothing forces the controls on.

``run`` is the REGULATED path, and this module is its admission gate. It is a
PURE function of a loaded bundle plus its deployment wiring: it executes nothing
and mutates nothing. It answers one question -- *may this bundle be executed
unattended in this deployment?* -- and it FAILS CLOSED, refusing (with a
structured reason naming the failing gate) unless ALL of the following hold:

1. **Certification** -- the bundle passes a required safety policy (default
   ``clinical-write``, or ``--policy``). An uncertified bundle is refused.
2. **Identity coverage** -- every entity-sensitive / consequential action is
   IDENTITY-ARMED. An unarmed consequential action (one that would act with no
   verified target identity) refuses the run; it is never silently proceeded.
3. **Effect coverage** -- every consequential write DECLARES a system-of-record
   effect contract (and none is an unconfirmed / fabricated binding). A write
   that would be verified by the SCREEN only -- because it declares no
   system-of-record effect -- refuses the run.
4. **Approval fallback** -- every declared write effect must be independently
   verifiable in THIS deployment (a verifier configured for its substrate).
   Where independent verification is impossible (no verifier wired), the write
   is admitted ONLY under EXPLICIT operator approval; absent approval, the run
   halts.
5. **Encryption at rest** -- the bundle's ``workflow.json`` and template crops
   are sealed with AES-256-GCM. A plaintext bundle is refused. Any additional
   plaintext template / screenshot asset is a loud WARNING by default and a
   REFUSAL under ``strict_templates``.
6. **Sealed manifest + version pin** -- the bundle carries an integrity-sealed
   manifest whose digest re-verifies (no post-seal tampering), and any supplied
   version pin (content digest / compiler version) matches. A mismatch refuses.

The gate reuses -- never re-implements -- the existing analysis primitives:
policy certification (:func:`openadapt_flow.policy.evaluate_policy`), the
identity-arming predicates (:func:`openadapt_flow.policy.is_identity_armed`),
the effect-contract predicates
(:func:`openadapt_flow.policy.has_system_effect`), and the manifest integrity
check (:func:`openadapt_flow.bundle_validation.verify_integrity`).

Scope: this gate ENFORCES coverage; it does not SYNTHESISE missing contracts
(no effect auto-inference -- that is a separate follow-up). An inadequate bundle
is refused, not repaired.
