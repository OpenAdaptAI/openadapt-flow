"""Fail-closed admission gate for governed execution (``openadapt-flow run``).

``replay`` is the permissive DEMO path: it will drive a bundle against an app
with every safety control (certification, identity arming, effect verification,
encryption) left OPTIONAL. Its report is explicitly non-production.

``run`` applies Demo, Standard, or Regulated requirements to this one admission
gate. It is a PURE function of a loaded bundle plus its deployment wiring: it
executes nothing and mutates nothing. It answers one question -- *may this
bundle be executed under the selected profile in this deployment?* -- and
FAILS CLOSED with a structured reason naming every failed requirement.

1. **Certification** -- the bundle passes a required safety policy (default
   ``clinical-write``, or ``--policy``). An uncertified bundle is refused.
2. **Identity coverage** -- every entity-sensitive / consequential action is
   IDENTITY-ARMED. An unarmed consequential action (one that would act with no
   verified target identity) refuses the run; it is never silently proceeded.
3. **Effect coverage** -- every consequential write DECLARES a system-of-record
   effect contract (and none is an unconfirmed / fabricated binding). A write
   that would be verified by the SCREEN only -- because it declares no
   system-of-record effect -- refuses the run.
4. **Effect execution** -- Standard and Regulated require a verifier meeting
   the workflow's declared evidence tier in THIS deployment. Demo and the
   legacy compatibility lane may use exact, bundle-bound approval, but that
   result remains unverified.
5. **Interstitial admission** -- every bundle/runtime interstitial declaration
   is schema-valid, every explicit asset is sealed in the bundle manifest, and
   the exact declaration digest is recorded for authorization binding.
6. **Encryption at rest** -- the bundle's ``workflow.json`` and template crops
   are sealed with AES-256-GCM. A plaintext bundle is refused. Any additional
   plaintext template / screenshot asset is a loud WARNING by default and a
   REFUSAL under ``strict_templates``.
7. **Sealed manifest + version pin** -- the bundle carries an integrity-sealed
   manifest whose digest re-verifies (no post-seal tampering), and any supplied
   version pin (content digest / compiler version) matches. A mismatch refuses.

The gate reuses -- never re-implements -- the existing analysis primitives:
policy certification (:func:`openadapt_flow.policy.evaluate_policy`), the
identity-arming predicates (:func:`openadapt_flow.policy.is_identity_armed`),
the effect-contract predicates
(:func:`openadapt_flow.policy.has_system_effect`), and the manifest integrity
check (:func:`openadapt_flow.bundle_validation.verify_integrity`).

Scope: this gate ENFORCES coverage; it does not SYNTHESISE missing contracts
(no effect auto-inference -- that is a separate follow-up). An inadequate bundle
is refused, not repaired.
