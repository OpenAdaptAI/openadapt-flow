"""Durable tiered runtime (RFC §5, Tier 3): checkpoint + pause/approve/resume.

The escalation tier of the Workflow-Program IR runtime
(``docs/design/WORKFLOW_PROGRAM_IR.md`` §5). Where the deterministic fast path
and the bounded local recovery cannot safely proceed, a production run must not
just die: it must **durably pause at the last verified checkpoint, persist why
it paused and the proposed operator options, and RESUME from that checkpoint**
after AUTHENTICATED approval -- never from step 0, and never by handing the
remaining workflow to a free-form agent.

Two checkpoint flavors:

- Linear ``steps`` runs checkpoint on a step index (:class:`RunCheckpoint`).
- Phase-2 PROGRAM runs checkpoint the whole INTERPRETER STATE -- the frame
  stack, loop cursors, bound params, and completed effect keys
  (:class:`ProgramCheckpoint`) -- so a resume RESTORES the interpreter rather
  than translating to a step index (which cannot express a loop cursor).

Resume is an authenticated approval workflow (P0-5): it requires an
:class:`ApprovalRecord` (approver / timestamp / resolution / bundle version),
revalidates the live app is still in the checkpoint's expected state, and
refuses a stale (expired) pause.

Import-light by design (pydantic + json + pathlib): no vision, no backend, no
model call.
