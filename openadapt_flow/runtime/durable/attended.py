"""Governed actions for a durably paused, staff-attended run.

The browser console is only a presentation surface.  This module owns the
engine contract that makes an attended action safe:

* an engine-issued capability is bound to the exact run, bundle revision,
  paused step/state, resume point, and expected next transition;
* an authenticated operator must present that exact capability before acting;
* one filesystem lease serializes decisions and one idempotency key makes a
  retried HTTP request replay its recorded result instead of acting twice;
* a human-completed step is *observed and verified*, never actuated again;
* delivery evidence is never accepted as outcome evidence;
* every accepted, refused, deferred, and escalated decision is auditable.

CAPTCHA, MFA, re-authentication, and other human-presence challenges are
deliberately outside the automation path.  A person completes them in the live
application and then asks OpenAdapt to verify the resulting state.

    ``reject`` is offered at every pause EXCEPT one where the runtime
    POSITIVELY recorded that this step may already have actuated, and that
    exception is the whole of its gating.

    It is deliberately not gated on halt category. Rejecting asserts something
    about THIS RUN -- that it must not proceed -- which an operator looking at
    the live application can conclude at a resolution halt as readily as at an
    effect halt. Gating on category would remove it from exactly the halts
    where ``continue`` IS offered (those with postconditions and a usable
    baseline) and leave it only where ``continue`` often is not, which inverts
    the reason it exists: the pressure toward the agreeable one-tap answer
    lives wherever the agreeable answer is one tap.

    An uncertain delivery is different in kind. The action may already have
    landed, so a button reading "stop this" would imply a write was prevented
    that may not have been, and the operator's task there is reconciliation
    rather than termination. ``escalate`` keeps the pause and hands it to
    someone who can reconcile; that is the correct path, so ``reject`` is
    withheld.

    Note what this does NOT read. ``_delivery_state`` is fail-closed and
    returns ``unknown`` for most halts simply because nothing proved
    non-delivery -- gating on it would withhold ``reject`` from nearly every
    pause and quietly undo the whole point. The gate is
    ``pending.delivery_uncertainty``, which exists only where the runtime
    recorded a real post-delivery uncertainty. :func:`execute_attended_action`
    adds the matching live-journal check, because a delivery can become

    Two durable artifacts, and both matter.

    The PAUSE is rewritten with ``status="rejected"`` rather than cleared.
    Clearing it would make the run look like one that was never paused, and the
    reason it stopped is precisely what an auditor needs; keeping it also makes
    the refusal in :func:`~.approval.enforce_resume_authorization` reachable, so
    "terminal" is enforced rather than merely reported.

    The REPORT gets ``canceled=True`` and a re-derived ``transaction_outcome``.
    This is the consequential design call, and the important part is what it
    does NOT do: it does not force ``CANCELED``. It states the human intent and
    lets :func:`~openadapt_flow.transaction.classify_transaction_outcome` decide
    what the evidence supports. A rejection over a run whose consequential steps
    are positively proven effect-free is ``CANCELED``. A rejection over one that
    may have written is still ``RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED`` -- an operator tapping
    "stop" must never be able to convert an unreconciled write into a clean bill
    of health, and the absence-proof gate that prevents it is the same one every
    other absence-asserting outcome passes through.

    ``execution_outcome`` is deliberately untouched. The run really did HALT;
    ``transaction_outcome`` refines what is known about the business effect
    without rewriting the coarse lifecycle, which is the contract the
    transaction module documents.

    Returns the terminal transaction outcome, or ``None`` when no readable
    report exists. A missing report does not block the rejection: the run is
    terminated by the pause status either way, and refusing to let an operator
    stop a run because its report is unreadable would be the wrong failure.
