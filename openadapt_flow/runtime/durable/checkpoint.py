"""Durable checkpoint + pending-escalation store (RFC §5, Tier 3).

The Workflow-Program IR RFC (``docs/design/WORKFLOW_PROGRAM_IR.md`` §5) makes
the runtime three-tier: a deterministic fast path, a bounded local model
recovery, and -- when neither can safely proceed -- a **durable pause /
approve / resume from the last verified checkpoint**. Today's replayer only
had the fast path and a bare ``halt``: on failure the run just dies, and a
re-run starts from step 0. That is unsafe in production, because re-running a
workflow that already performed consequential writes re-performs them.

This module is the persistence substrate for Tier 3. It is deliberately
import-light (pydantic + json + pathlib only -- no vision, no backend, no
model), and it lives in its OWN package so the state-machine interpreter
(Phase 2, which rewrites ``replayer.py`` heavily) can adopt it with a minimal,
localized set of replayer touch-points (see the module docstring of
``openadapt_flow.runtime.durable.controller``).

Two durable artifacts, both written under the run directory:

- :class:`RunCheckpoint` -- one per VERIFIED step (identity passed, effects
  CONFIRMED, postconditions passed), written to ``run_dir/checkpoints/``. It
  records enough to RESUME: the step index/id (and, for the Phase-2 state
  machine, an optional ``state_id``), the run's parameter bindings, and the
  index to continue from. Deterministic, cheap, ``$0``.
- :class:`PendingEscalation` -- written to ``run_dir/pending_escalation.json``
  when the run HALTS for an operator (a non-CONFIRMED effect that escalates,
  an unmet consequential guard, an unconfirmed placeholder effect, an
  unresolved disambiguation, ...). It captures WHY the run paused and the
  proposed operator options, and points at the last verified checkpoint so a
  human can approve and RESUME from there -- never from step 0, and never by
  handing the remaining workflow to a free-form agent.

A small :class:`RunManifest` (``run_dir/checkpoints/_manifest.json``) records
the bundle directory and parameter bindings so :func:`~.resume.resume` can
reconstruct the run from ``run_dir`` alone.
