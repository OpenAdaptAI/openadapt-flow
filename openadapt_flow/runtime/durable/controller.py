"""The durable-run controller: the replayer's Tier-3 hook (RFC §5).

``DurableRun`` is the object the ``Replayer`` drives to make a run durable. It
owns the :class:`~.checkpoint.CheckpointStore` and turns each ``StepResult``
into the right durable artifact:

- a VERIFIED step (``result.ok``) -> a :class:`~.checkpoint.RunCheckpoint`
  written under ``run_dir/checkpoints/`` (the resume point advances);
- a HALTED step (``not result.ok``) -> a
  :class:`~.checkpoint.PendingEscalation` written to
  ``run_dir/pending_escalation.json`` that captures WHY the run paused, the
  proposed operator options, and the last verified checkpoint to resume from.

The replayer's coupling to this module is intentionally TINY, so the Phase-2
state-machine interpreter (which rewrites ``replayer.py`` heavily) can keep it
across the rebase. The touch-points are:

1. ``Replayer.__init__`` accepts ``durable: bool = False`` and stores it.
2. ``Replayer.run`` accepts ``resume_from: Optional[int] = None``; when
   durability is on it constructs one ``DurableRun`` and, per step, calls
   :meth:`DurableRun.record` right after the result is appended.
3. A resume skips already-verified steps and pre-loads their results via
   :func:`resumed_step_results`.

Nothing here makes a model call or touches the backend/vision -- durability is
pure bookkeeping over the ``StepResult`` the replayer already produces.
