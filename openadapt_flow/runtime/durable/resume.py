"""Resume a durably-paused run from its last verified checkpoint (RFC §5).

:func:`resume` is the Tier-3 resume entrypoint, and P0-5 makes it an
AUTHENTICATED APPROVAL workflow. Given a ``run_dir`` that holds a
:class:`~.checkpoint.PendingEscalation` (and the checkpoints written during the
original run), it:

1. ENFORCES an authenticated approval (RFC §5, P0-5): an
   :class:`~.approval.ApprovalRecord` (approver / timestamp / resolution /
   bundle version) must accompany the resume, the pause must not have expired
   (stale-pause window), and the approval must match the current bundle version.
   A caller without a valid approval record CANNOT resume;
2. reads the :class:`~.checkpoint.RunManifest` to recover the bundle and the
   run's parameter bindings (so the caller need only supply a live ``Replayer``);
3. REVALIDATES the live app is still in the checkpoint's expected state (and that
   the already-confirmed effects still hold) before continuing;
4. RESTORES the run from its last verified checkpoint and re-drives it from
   there onward -- NEVER from step 0.

For a Phase-2 PROGRAM run the resume point is not a step index but the whole
INTERPRETER STATE (:class:`~.program_checkpoint.ProgramCheckpoint`): the frame
stack, loop cursors, bound params, and completed effect keys are RESTORED so an
already-confirmed consequential write is never re-performed and a mid-loop pause
finishes the in-progress row and runs the remaining rows. For a linear run the
resume point is the last verified step index (unchanged from before).

Explicit non-goal (RFC §5): resume is DETERMINISTIC. It hands the remaining
workflow to the SAME deterministic replayer, never to a free-form agent.

    Args:
        run_dir: The original run directory (holds the checkpoints, the
            manifest, the pending escalation, and any approval record).
        replayer: A live :class:`~openadapt_flow.runtime.replayer.Replayer`
            (its backend/vision cannot be serialized, so the caller provides a
            fresh one bound to the recovered system). Durability is force-
            enabled on it so the resumed leg keeps checkpointing.
        approval: The authenticated authorization to resume (P0-5). When omitted,
            an ``approval.json`` written by the ``approve`` command is used. If
            neither is present (or the record carries no approver), resume is
            REFUSED with :class:`~.approval.ApprovalRequired`.
        bundle_dir: Override the bundle recorded in the manifest (rarely
            needed); defaults to the manifest's ``bundle_dir``.
        params: Override the parameter bindings recorded in the manifest;
            defaults to the manifest's ``params`` so the resume re-binds
            identically.
        worklists: Override the worklists recorded in the manifest; defaults to
            the original frozen worklists so program loops resume identically.
        save_healed_to: Override the manifest's healed-bundle path.
        execution_target_kind: Resolved backend token for the resumed leg's
            report and substrate-aware runtime attestation.
        now: Injectable clock for the stale-pause check (defaults to UTC now).
        key: At-rest passphrase for an ENCRYPTED run (its checkpoints and/or its
            bundle). Resolved from ``key`` or ``OPENADAPT_BUNDLE_KEY``. Used to
            decrypt the durable checkpoints, load an encrypted bundle, and keep
            the resumed leg sealing new checkpoints. None => plaintext.

    Returns:
        The :class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.RunReport` for the resumed leg.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: when ``run_dir`` has no manifest (it was not run
            durably) and no ``bundle_dir`` override is supplied.
        ResumeRefused: (``ApprovalRequired`` / ``PauseExpired`` /
            ``BundleMismatch`` / ``StateDiverged``) when the resume is not
            authorized, the pause expired, the bundle changed, or the live app
