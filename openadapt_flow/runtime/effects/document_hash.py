"""Filesystem document-hash system-of-record :class:`EffectVerifier`.

A deliberately DIFFERENT verifier *type* from the HTTP substrates (:mod:`.rest`,
:mod:`.fhir`): here the system of record is a directory of written documents,
and the effect is checked with a content hash, not a network read. Many
consequential desktop workflows end in a document -- a generated PDF, an
exported report, a signed form dropped in an output folder -- and the truth of
"it was actually produced, once, with the right content" lives on the
filesystem, not on the screen that said "Export complete".

Records are the files under ``root`` matching ``glob``; each flattens to
``{"id", "name", "sha256", "size"}`` so the shared :func:`judge_records`
decides:

- ``record_written`` (``match={"name": ...}``, ``expected_count=1``): exactly
  one document exists for the key -- a duplicate export that wrote a second
  ``report (1).pdf`` is caught as ``observed_count > expected``;
- ``field_equals`` (``field="sha256"``, ``value=<expected digest>``): the
  document's bytes match the expected content -- a truncated / partial write
  is caught even though the file exists.

Fail-safe: a missing or unreadable ``root`` reads as *unreadable* ->
INDETERMINATE -> HALT (the export target being gone is never "no document
expected"). This substrate runs live in CI (no external service).
