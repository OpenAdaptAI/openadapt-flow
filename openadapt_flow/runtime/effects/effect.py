"""Typed effects and the ``EffectVerifier`` protocol -- verify REAL effects
against a system of record, not the screen.

This is the concrete runtime for the ``Effect`` type proposed in the
Workflow-Program IR RFC (``docs/design/WORKFLOW_PROGRAM_IR.md``, PR #61):
that RFC promotes today's vision-only :class:`openadapt_flow.ir.Postcondition`
into a *typed* ``Effect`` with **system-of-record** kinds
(``record_written`` / ``field_equals``) whose probe is backend-specific (an
API / DB read), closing the transactional gap the fault-model study measured
(``docs/LIMITS.md`` "5 of 7 write faults silent"; ``benchmark/fault_model/``).

Why not the screen? A vision postcondition answers *"do the pixels look like a
save happened?"* -- which a partial save, an optimistic-UI-then-reject, a
duplicate submission, a lost update, or a double-delivered click all satisfy
while the **record** is wrong or missing. An ``EffectVerifier`` answers the
only question a record system may trust: *"is the intended record actually in
the system of record, exactly once, with the right field values?"*

Design posture -- mirror the identity gate (``runtime.identity``): **fail safe
to HALT, refuse rather than guess.** A verdict is one of

- :attr:`Verdict.CONFIRMED`     -- the effect is present and correct -> proceed;
- :attr:`Verdict.REFUTED`       -- the system of record affirmatively
  contradicts the effect (missing / duplicated / wrong value / collateral
  loss) -> HALT (never accept as success);
- :attr:`Verdict.INDETERMINATE` -- the system of record is unreachable or
  unreadable, so the effect *cannot be certified* -> HALT (never assume
  success). Consistent with the identity ladder's ``unreadable`` -> refuse.

Both non-confirmed verdicts set :attr:`EffectVerdict.should_halt`. There is no
"probably fine": an unverifiable consequential write halts, exactly as an
unreadable identity band does.

Everything here is import-light (pydantic only); concrete substrates
(``rest`` / ``fhir`` / ``document_hash``) bring their own I/O deps lazily.
