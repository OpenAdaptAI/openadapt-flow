"""Healing: refresh anchors from the live frame after non-template resolution.

When a step succeeds via any rung other than ``template``, the runtime emits
a :class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.HealEvent` carrying a refreshed anchor: a new
template crop taken from the live frame at the resolved location, an updated
region/click_point, and re-OCRed ``ocr_text``. The event is applied to the
in-memory workflow, persisted under ``run_dir/heals/<step_id>/``, and — when
``save_healed_to`` is set on the run — folded into a full healed bundle.
