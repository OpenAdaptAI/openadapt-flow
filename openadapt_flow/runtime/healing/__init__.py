"""Governed healing: a repair is a reviewable, gated PATCH -- never a silent swap.

A heal may change HOW a step is performed (its locator / rung) but must NEVER
silently weaken WHAT it means (its identity band) or how its effects are
verified. This package turns a raw :class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.HealEvent` into a
reviewable :class:`HealPatch`, runs it through a deterministic regression GATE
(identity + effect + risk) and promotion pipeline, and reproduces synthetic
UI-drift to validate a patch before it is promoted. Everything here is ``$0``
and model-free on the runtime hot path.

Entry point for the replayer: :func:`govern_heal`. Reusable validation:
:mod:`openadapt_flow.runtime.healing.perturbation`.
