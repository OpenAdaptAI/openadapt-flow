"""Governed healing: the invariant, the regression gate, the promotion pipeline.

A heal is a REPAIR, and a repair carries the same risk as any edit to a
safety-critical program: it can silently weaken the thing that made the
program safe. Two external reviews found the concrete instance -- a heal could
refresh a step's identity context to ``None``, disabling the pre-click
identity gate for that step (an ARMED step silently downgraded to UNARMED and
still reported green). This module closes that hole with one invariant and a
gate that refuses any patch that would violate it:

    A repair may change HOW an operation is performed (its locator / rung),
    but NEVER silently weaken WHAT it means (its identity band) or how its
    effects are verified (its effect coverage), nor downgrade its risk class.

Everything here is deterministic and ``$0`` -- NO model calls on the runtime
hot path. The identity check reuses the same OCR band matcher the pre-click
gate uses (:func:`openadapt_flow.runtime.identity.verify_target_identity`), so
a patch is judged by the very rule that protects the click.

Pipeline: candidate patch -> regression GATE (identity + effect + risk) ->
CANARY (apply, monitor against prior traces + perturbations) -> PROMOTE or
ROLLBACK. A patch that fails the gate is QUARANTINED and the run HALTS
(refuse-rather-than-guess); it is never auto-applied.

    A repair passes iff, for the identity evidence the pre-heal anchor
    carried, the post-heal anchor carries evidence that is at least as
    strong:

    1. **Arming is never dropped.** If the old anchor was identity-armed
       (a recorded context band or structured identity), the new one must be
       too. Refreshing the band to ``None`` -- the exact reviewed bug --
       flips the step from ARMED to UNARMED and fails here.
    2. **Structured identity is never dropped.** The heal only re-derives the
       OCR context band; the structured-text tier (the highest-fidelity
       identity evidence) must survive verbatim.
    3. **The refreshed band still means the SAME entity.** When the old
       anchor had a context band, the new band -- read as the "observed"
       text -- must still VERIFY against it. A band that no longer verifies
       (unreadable, too generic, or affirmatively a DIFFERENT entity) is a
       silent weakening even though the field is non-empty, so it fails too.

# NO LONGER verifiable. We model that as a baseline of per-effect verdicts
# taken BEFORE the patch, re-checked AFTER: a patch is refused if any effect
# that was CONFIRMED (verifiable, correct) becomes non-confirmed. The verifier
# is injected (the effects runtime, PR #63) so this stays deterministic and
# substrate-neutral; when no effect baseline is supplied the check is a no-op
# pass (a locator heal on a step with no system-of-record effect).
