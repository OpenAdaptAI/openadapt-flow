"""Reviewable heal PATCH: what a repair changed, as an auditable diff.

A heal must never be a silently-swapped bundle. :class:`HealPatch` turns a
:class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.HealEvent` into a structured, diffable record of
exactly what a repair changed (which anchor field, from what to what) and how
it moved the step's IDENTITY band (the evidence the pre-click identity gate
keys on). It is the unit the governance gate rules on and the artifact an
operator reviews before a patch is promoted into a healed bundle.

The invariant a patch exists to enforce: a repair may change HOW an operation
is performed (its locator/rung), but never silently weaken WHAT it means or
how its effects are verified. The patch makes any such weakening VISIBLE
(``identity_before`` vs ``identity_after``) so the gate can refuse it rather
than let it pass green.
