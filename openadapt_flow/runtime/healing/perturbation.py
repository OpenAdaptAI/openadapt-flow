"""Deterministic synthetic UI-drift perturbation + regression harness.

A heal claims "the target moved / re-themed / re-flowed and my refreshed
anchor still finds and verifies it." This harness lets us CHECK that claim
before promoting the patch, without a live app: it generates deterministic,
``$0`` synthetic drifts of a recorded frame (shifted / scaled / re-themed /
re-flowed) with a KNOWN post-drift target location, then replays a candidate
patch against them plus any prior recorded traces and reports whether the
patch still (a) locates the target and (b) verifies its identity band under
every drift. A patch that regresses on any case is not promotable.

Reusable by design: held-out identity validation and future patch-induction
both reuse the same generator and the same replay/report, so a patch is
judged by exactly the drift battery the runtime will face.

Image work is PIL-only and seeded -- fully deterministic; no model calls.
