"""Target-identity evidence: capture at compile time, verify before acting.

Template/geometry evidence answers "does the recorded *position* still look
right?", not "is this the recorded *target*?" — for a button inside a table
row the discriminative text (the row's name column) sits outside the
template crop, so a pixel-identical sibling row scores ~1.0 while being the
wrong entity (see docs/validation/VALIDATION.md, Track A).

This module closes that gap with a horizontal *context band*: the full-width
strip of OCR text at the target's row, minus the target's own label (labels
are mutable evidence the ladder heals through — rename drift must not fail
identity). The compiler stores the band text on the anchor
(``Anchor.context_text``); the replayer re-reads the band around the
*resolved* point before clicking and requires either:

- **context mode** — an order-insensitive token match against the recorded
  band text (see :func:`band_match`): matched tokens must cover >=
  ``COVERAGE_THRESHOLD`` of the recorded band, no contiguous run of
  uncovered recorded characters may exceed ``UNCOVERED_RUN_CAP`` (a wrong
  entity is a contiguous mismatch — a replaced name — even when long
  shared row text keeps raw coverage high), AND no more than
  ``CONTRADICTED_CHARS_CAP`` characters may be NEAR-MISSES: tokens only
  match when OCR-equivalent under the engine's character-confusion
  classes, and an unmatched token whose observed counterpart is a
  near-name ('Phil'/'Philip', 'John'/'Joan', an off-by-one DOB) is
  affirmative wrong-sibling evidence with its own, stricter budget.
  Since the 2026-07-10 out-of-corpus review, four further budgets close
  the classes corpus v1 excluded by construction: a name-plausible token
  matched ONLY by letter-letter confusion equivalence is SUSPECT (a
  Neil/Nell collision is indistinguishable from a misread — abort, see
  ``SUSPECT_CHARS_CAP``); a raw-unequal, non-confusion-equivalent 1-2
  char token is contradiction (middle initials, the SEX column); an
  observed name-shaped token the recorded band cannot explain is
  contradiction (appended names, two-row merges, rows that merely
  MENTION the recorded patient); and an ABSENT name-like alphabetic
  token >= 4 chars refuses even inside the generic run cap (identity
  must not verify with its identity token never read).
  Order-insensitivity matters because OCR re-reads the same band in a
  different segmentation order between visits (e.g. page chrome around a
  modal), or
- **param mode** — when a workflow parameter's demonstrated value is
  embedded in the recorded band (a parameterized *target*, e.g. the patient
  row), the run's value is substituted into the recorded band and the WHOLE
  substituted band is verified: the run's value must appear in the live
  band AND the band's non-param residue must still match. A band that
  merely mentions the run's value somewhere is not identity.

Both checks compare squashed (lowercased, whitespace-free) text, the same
OCR-tolerant form used by ``benchmark.verify``. Timestamp-bearing lines are
excluded from the recorded context (volatile by construction, same
rationale as the compiler's postcondition filter).

NOTE (commit 8421d51): parameterized values are never asserted as compiled
POSTCONDITIONS — that rule stands. Identity verification is a *pre-action*
check against runtime values, which is exactly what a parameterized target
needs.

Everything here is import-light (no cv2/OCR at module import); image work is
lazy so unit tests can fake the vision namespace.

# SUSPECT tokens (2026-07-10 out-of-corpus review): a DISCRIMINATOR token

# match on a discriminator is indistinguishable at band level from a
# wrong-row read. Two discriminator classes qualify:
#
#   - NAMES (Blocker 1): a name-plausible token (>= MIN_BLOCK chars, no
#     digits on either side) — 'Neil'/'Nell' (i/l), 'Clay'/'Day' (cl/d),
#     'Marnie'/'Mamie' (rn/m) are DIFFERENT REAL NAMES that canonicalize
#     identically. Digit-class noise on a NAME ('Belford'/'Be1ford',
#     '5ample') stays a clean match — a human name contains no digit, so
#     the recorded token being all-alpha proves it is a name and the
#     digit came from OCR, not a rival name.
#
#   - IDENTIFIERS (5th reopening, second review): a RECORDED token that
#     CONTAINS A DIGIT (MRN, account number, chart ref, DOB) whose match
#     needed a letter/digit confusion (l/1, O/0, S/5, Z/2, B/8, g/9) is
#     a different identifier, 'A01234'/'AO1234' — and the identifier is
#     precisely what disambiguates same-name patients. The round-3 rule
#     missed this because it keyed on name-plausibility (false for any
#     token with a digit), so the suspect budget was OFF for exactly the
#     tokens whose confusion equivalence is most dangerous. Scoping on
#     the RECORDED token (not the observed one) is what keeps
#     name-with-digit-noise verifying while identifier-with-digit
#     aborting: the recording carries the ground truth of the token's
#     type. All-digit differences (748291 vs 748292) are NOT
#     confusion-equivalent (two digits are never in one class), so they
#     mismatch via coverage/contradiction, not here.
#
# The budget is zero for both. For identifiers this is option A of the
# review (no corroboration escape): a confusion-differing identifier
# aborts even when name and DOB raw-match, so two same-name patients

# matched, halting identity WHENEVER such an identifier was present — even
# when a discriminative name+DOB independently carried the identity. That
# had two failures, both proven on the real render->OCR->match pipeline:
#
#   1. DIGIT-SIDE MISS (false accept, ~87%). A real MRN is
#      <alpha prefix><numeric body> (MG480312, AC50061). When the confusable
#      glyph is DIGIT-FLANKED, RapidOCR reads the DIGIT form on BOTH a
#      patient (AC50061) and a DIFFERENT same-name/DOB patient (AC5OO61,
#      letter O) — both collapse to 'AC50061', NO homoglyph LETTER survives,
#      #26's letter-only flag misses it, and the sibling verifies. No
#      string-level flag on the identifier can recover a distinction OCR
#      destroyed at the pixel level, and flagging the digit side (any 0/1 in
#      an MRN) would halt ~3 of every 4 real MRNs — catastrophic over-halt.
#   2. OVER-HALT (false abort). #26 halted a TRUE row whose own MRN merely
#      contained an O/l even when the patient's name+DOB clearly and
#      discriminatively identified them (measured 18.89% dense / 33% on a
#      realistic different-name/DOB corpus).
#
# The fix changes WHAT identity trusts, not the glyph rule. Identity is
# verified on the OCR-RELIABLE, linguistically-redundant signal — the
# patient NAME and DOB together — and a confusable-glyph identifier is
# CORROBORATION only, never the sole basis to verify:
#
#   - If a DISCRIMINATIVE NAME is present and matched (a name-like token
#     >= ID_CARRY_NAME_MIN chars that is not a generic column word — the
#     primary human identifier; a matched DOB corroborates it, name+DOB
#     together), identity is CARRIED by name/DOB. A confusable-glyph MRN in
#     the band does NOT block verification — most real patients differ by
#     name/DOB, so a wrong (sibling) row differs there and is caught by
#     coverage / contradiction; the MRN never has to be trusted. This is
#     the common case and must NOT over-halt.
#   - If identity rests SOLELY on a glyph-vulnerable identifier — no
#     discriminative name carries it (the clicked NAME cell is excluded and
#     only DOB + MRN + generic columns remain) and the identity turns on an
#     identifier OCR cannot be trusted to have read glyph-for-glyph —
#     identity is UNVERIFIABLE and HALTS. This is a safe false-ABORT (a
#     hybrid-fallback escalation or a human retry), never a false-accept.

# (MG4408 vs MG44O8) render to a BYTE-IDENTICAL OCR band -- literally the same
# string a legit re-read of the true row produces -- so no function downstream
# of OCR can separate them (same input, no distinguishing output). This is an
# impossibility result for OCR-based identity, not a tuning gap.
#
# The escape is to stop trusting OCR for identity where a higher-fidelity
# signal exists. When the backend exposes STRUCTURED text
# (openadapt_flow.backend.IdentityBackend.structured_text_at -- the DOM on a
# browser, the UIA/AX tree on native desktop) the recorded target's structured
# identity string and the live structured string at the resolved point are
# compared DIRECTLY: an exact/normalized compare in which O and 0 are distinct
# characters. The glyph-collapse cannot occur -- the two rows are different
# strings in the DOM/a11y tree -- so the class closes with NO OCR ambiguity and
# NO availability cost (identity no longer depends on OCR reading the MRN
# glyph-for-glyph).
#
# Identity is therefore an EXTENSIBLE LADDER of verifier tiers, each returning
# an IdentityCheck (verified / mismatch) or None (this tier is UNAVAILABLE for
# this substrate -- fall through to the next):
#
#   tier 1  structured text (DOM / UIA / AX)   -- verify_structured_identity
#   tier 2  pixel-compare identifier crop      -- verify_pixel_identity
#           -- for pure-pixel substrates (Citrix/RDP/VDI, broken a11y) that
#           expose NO structured text. OCR collapses O/0 and l/1, but the
#           PIXELS do not -- a different patient's MRN renders to different
#           pixels even when OCR reads them identically -- so a localized
#           pixel comparison of the recorded vs live identifier crop catches
#           the glyph-collapse where there is no DOM/a11y text. VERIFIES on a
#           matching render, MISMATCHES on a localized glyph change, ABSTAINS
#           under drift (validated: benchmark/pixel_identity).
#   tier 3  local-VLM veto (OPTIONAL)           -- verify_vlm_identity
#           -- injected, OFF by default. Only when identity rests on a
#           glyph-confusable identifier AND the cheaper tiers abstained (drift
#           the pixel tier can't judge): a local open VLM answers same/
#           different, VETO-ONLY (different/unsure -> halt; never grants a

# These two tiers close the ladder's SEAM between structured text and OCR for
# PURE-PIXEL substrates (Citrix/RDP/VDI, broken a11y) that expose no
# DOM/a11y string. Both were validated as standalone probes before promotion:
#
#   tier 2  PIXEL COMPARE   (benchmark/pixel_identity, PR #29) -- the rendered
#           pixels retain the O/0 and l/1 distinction OCR collapses, so a
#           localized max abs-diff of the recorded vs live identifier crop
#           separates the glyph-collapse wrong-patient pairs at AUC 1.0 on a
#           STABLE render (same_max 0.0 vs diff_min ~0.097; threshold ~0.049).
#           It BREAKS under render drift (dark theme / zoom / font), where a
#           SAME-value crop's distance climbs above the threshold too. So it is
#           promoted FAIL-SAFE: it VERIFIES only when the render matches (a
#           near-zero localized distance -- structurally impossible for a
#           different identifier, whose min stable distance is ~0.097),
#           MISMATCHES only when the difference is LOCALIZED on an otherwise
#           matching render (a single differing glyph), and ABSTAINS (returns
#           None -> next tier) the moment a WHOLE-crop change signals drift.
#           It can never false-accept: VERIFY requires a distance no different
#           identifier ever produces. Free, no model.
#
#   tier 3  VLM VETO         (benchmark/vlm_identity, PR #28) -- a LOCAL open
#           VLM (Qwen3-VL-4B via MLX, ~0.8s/call, ZERO API calls) asked
#           "same identifier or different?". VETO-ONLY: it can only REJECT
#           (different/unsure -> halt), never grant a pass a cheaper tier
#           refused, and it never overrides an earlier tier's mismatch (the
#           ladder order guarantees it runs only after the cheaper tiers
#           ABSTAINED). OPTIONAL and config-gated like the grounder: injected
#           via an ``IdentityVLM`` verifier, ``None`` by default, so the
#           default install needs no model. On the digit-flanked O/0 collapse
#           surface it scored 0% false-accept + 100% detection and 0%
#           over-halt under theme drift (where pixel-compare breaks); it
#           over-halts (safely) on zoom/font.
#
# When both pixel and VLM abstain, the ladder falls to the OCR name+DOB tier

# wrong patient into a verified one; the worst any drift can force is a HALT.

# glyph occupies few canonical columns, and a one-glyph-different MRN's diff
# DILUTES below PIXEL_SAME_THRESHOLD -> it VERIFIES a DIFFERENT patient.
# Empirically: a 420px-wide cell, AC50061 vs AC58061, gives localized-max
# 0.016 < 0.0487 -> false-accept (while a same-value 1px cross-render JITTER
# gives 0.087 -> false-abort: the metric is inverted at realistic scale).
#
# The forward-looking metric (pixel_localized_spike) is scale-INVARIANT: it
# canonicalizes to a fixed HEIGHT preserving aspect (so a glyph is a
# consistent width at any crop scale) and takes the localized max as a SPIKE
# above the per-window median (drift) floor -- a one-glyph MRN change scores a
# consistent ~0.038 spike at 120px/420px/840px cell widths, while uniform
# theme drift scores ~0 (max == median). That makes a DIFFERENT MRN MISMATCH
