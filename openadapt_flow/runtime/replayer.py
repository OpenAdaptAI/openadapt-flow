"""Replayer: execute a compiled Workflow against a Backend.

Per step: settle, screenshot, resolve the anchor via the resolution ladder,
enforce the irreversible-step risk gate, verify the resolved target's
IDENTITY against the anchor's recorded context band (never click a
positional look-alike — see ``runtime.identity``), act through the Backend
(TYPE actions additionally verify the input visibly landed, with one
refocus-and-retype retry), settle again, and poll postconditions until they
pass or time out (with one re-settle retry). Postcondition failure is
semantic drift: the run halts, naming the step and embedding its
before/after screenshots in the report.

Steps that declare system-of-record ``effects`` (``ir.Step.effects``) get a
SECOND, independent verification the screen oracle cannot provide: an
``EffectVerifier`` (``runtime.effects``) snapshots the real system of record
BEFORE the action and, after the action's screen postconditions pass, rules
each declared ``Effect`` CONFIRMED / REFUTED / INDETERMINATE against that
record (an API/DB read, never the pixels). A non-CONFIRMED verdict HALTS the
run — mirroring the identity gate's refuse-rather-than-guess posture — and for
an irreversible effect a configured compensator may ``reconcile_or_escalate``
(RECONCILED continues, ESCALATE halts). A step that declares effects with NO
verifier configured is a deployment error and HALTS (an unverifiable
consequential write is never allowed to pass). This path makes ZERO model
calls — effect verification reads the system of record.

Steps that succeed via any rung other than ``template`` are healed: the
anchor is refreshed from the live frame, the heal is recorded under
``run_dir/heals/<step_id>/``, and — when ``save_healed_to`` is set — a full
healed bundle is written.

            ``find_text``, ``text_present``, ``ocr``, ``phash_png``,
            ``phash_distance``, and ``wait_settled``. Defaults to the

            module, imported lazily so unit tests can inject a fake without

            (``runtime.effects``) bound to the deployment's system of record
            (a REST/FHIR API, a document store). When set, any step that

            invoked via ``reconcile_or_escalate`` when an IRREVERSIBLE effect

            every refuted/indeterminate effect simply halts.
        api_actuator: Optional ``ApiActuator`` (``runtime.actuators``) bound to
            the deployment's API. It is the TOP of the capability ladder: when a
            step carries an ``ir.Step.api_binding`` and this actuator is set,
            the step's write is PERFORMED via the API (deterministic, $0, no
            model), CONFIRMED by the ``effect_verifier``, and the GUI

            today (the API tier is an optimization whose safe fallback IS the
            GUI). Never makes a model call.
        durable: When True, enable the Tier-3 durable runtime (RFC §5): write a
            checkpoint after each verified step and, on a halt, a durable
            pending escalation, so the run can be RESUMED from the last verified
            checkpoint (``openadapt_flow.runtime.durable.resume``) rather than
            re-run from step 0. None of this touches the backend, vision, or a

        the subflow/loop nesting) and pops it on the way out. ``graph_id`` is the
        durable id of this graph (``TOP_GRAPH_ID`` or a subflow name);
        ``loop_cursor`` is set for a loop-body iteration.

        Returns normally on completion (a ``success`` terminal RETURNS to the
        caller -- for a subflow that means "continue after the call"; for the
        top program it means the run succeeded). Raises ``_ProgramHalt`` to stop

        The TOP of the capability ladder (RFC section 4 ``api`` tier): a

        ``EffectVerifier`` as a GUI write. For an API write the target
        "identity" is the explicit API parameter -- stronger than a resolved
        pixel band -- so no identity gate is weakened by skipping the GUI.

        Fail-safe ordering (the no-double-write contract):

        - refuse BEFORE any request when the write could not be confirmed (no
          effect contract, or no verifier) -- an unverifiable consequential
          write never proceeds;
        - snapshot the system of record, then actuate ONCE;

        - HALT (request sent, outcome unknown / rejected) -> stop the run; the

        - ACTUATED (2xx) -> CONFIRM with the EffectVerifier; a non-CONFIRMED

        :func:`openadapt_flow.runtime.identity.run_identity_ladder`):

        - **tier 1 -- structured text (DOM / UIA / AX).** When the bundle
          carries the target's recorded structured identity
          (``anchor.structured_identity``) AND the live backend exposes
          ``structured_text_at`` (browser DOM, or native a11y tree), identity
          is verified by an exact/normalized compare of the recorded vs live
          structured text at the resolved point -- O and 0 are distinct
          characters, so the same-name/same-DOB glyph-collapse that defeats
          OCR cannot occur, and the class closes with no OCR-availability
          cost. A mismatch here is authoritative: no lower tier overrides it.
        - **tier 2 -- pixel-compare identifier crop.** For pure-pixel
          substrates (Citrix/RDP/VDI, broken a11y) that carry a recorded
          identifier crop (``anchor.identifier_crop`` / ``identifier_region``)
          but no structured text: compare the recorded identifier crop's
          pixels to the live crop re-cut at the resolved point. OCR collapses
          O/0 and l/1, the pixels do not. VERIFIES on a matching render,
          MISMATCHES on a localized glyph change, ABSTAINS under render drift
          (see :func:`identity.verify_pixel_identity`).
        - **tier 3 -- local-VLM veto (OPTIONAL, off by default).** Only when a
          verifier is injected (``self.identity_vlm``), identity rests on a
          glyph-confusable identifier, AND the cheaper tiers abstained: a
          local open VLM answers same/different, VETO-ONLY (different/unsure
          -> halt). See :func:`identity.verify_vlm_identity`.
        - **tier N -- OCR name+DOB-primary band (#27).** The pixel-substrate
          fallback: :meth:`_verify_identity_ocr`, with its proven-irreducible
          same-name/same-DOB residual that HALTS on the sole-ambiguous-
          identifier case (docs/LIMITS.md).

        on a settled frame — not a fixed number of times. That predicate is the
