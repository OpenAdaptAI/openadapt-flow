"""Explicit transaction + reconciliation semantics (roadmap Section 3).

The runtime already produces a COARSE lifecycle -- ``success`` / ``halt`` /
``failure`` -- and a first evidence-qualified projection
(``execution_outcome``: VERIFIED / COMPLETED_UNVERIFIED / HALTED / FAILED /
ROLLED_BACK).  Neither of those states what is known about the BUSINESS EFFECT
when a run stops: a governed halt where nothing was written and a stop where a
consequential write may have half-landed both collapse to "HALTED / not
success".

This module refines that coarse outcome into a first-class TERMINAL TRANSACTION
outcome (:class:`TransactionOutcome`) that describes what the evidence proves
about the effect, records a per-step :class:`~openadapt_flow.ir.EffectJournalEntry`
ledger, and provides a caller-supplied :class:`IdempotencyLedger` so a repeat
under the same key does not re-actuate.  It is a LEAF: it reads only typed
fields already present on the ``RunReport`` (mirroring
``execution_profiles.build_outcome_envelope``), so it adds no import weight and
leaks no PHI.  ``execution_outcome`` and ``outcome_envelope`` are unchanged --
every existing consumer keeps working; new consumers read
``transaction_outcome``.

Scoped OUT of this first PR (follow-ups): full saga compensation steps, the
human-reconciliation-task UI, and Cloud/runner propagation of the taxonomy.
