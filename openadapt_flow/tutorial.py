"""The bundled tutorial: the free path, end to end, that actually VERIFIES.

Why this module exists
----------------------

``replay`` runs the ``demo`` execution profile, whose contract sets
``require_effect_contracts=False``.  ``classify_execution_outcome`` therefore
maps every completed demo run to ``COMPLETED_UNVERIFIED`` unconditionally --
correctly, because a demo run proves nothing about a system of record.  Under
that profile ``VERIFIED`` is unreachable by construction, and it MUST stay
unreachable: a profile that can print ``VERIFIED`` without effect evidence is
exactly the failure this product exists to prevent.

The honest fix is not to loosen the profile.  It is to give the tutorial the
evidence the ``standard`` profile already demands, and then run it under that
profile.  Concretely, three things change and nothing is relaxed:

1. **A real system of record.**  The bundled MockMed application is served
   through its transactional persistence boundary
   (:mod:`openadapt_flow.mockmed.fault_server`) with ``?fault=ok``, so a save
   reaches a backend store instead of only mutating an in-page object.  That
   store is readable out of band at ``GET /api/db`` -- a path the application
   itself never calls, so the screen cannot influence what the verifier reads.
2. **A real effect contract.**  The demonstration is recorded with a
   ``system_of_record_reader`` attached, so each event retains the OBSERVED
   before/after record delta.  The compiler then DERIVES the effect contract
   from that delta (:mod:`openadapt_flow.compiler.effect_mining`); it is not
   hand-written, and a placeholder effect is refused here rather than trusted.
3. **A real admission.**  The run is admitted through the unmodified
   fail-closed :func:`~openadapt_flow.run_gate.evaluate_run_gate` under the
   ``standard`` profile against the shipped ``clinical-write`` policy, and
   executed with a :class:`RestRecordVerifier` reading ``/api/db``.

The outcome is ``VERIFIED`` because the write was independently confirmed in a
system of record at ``INDEPENDENT_SYSTEM`` tier, above the tier the profile
requires.  If any contract is unmet the gate refuses and this module fails
loudly rather than degrading the claim.

One further deliberate difference from
:func:`openadapt_flow.demo_driver.record_triage_demo`: the tutorial does not
demonstrate the login screen.  Typing a credential into a recording produces an
artifact whose plaintext value is a secret carrier for no evidentiary gain, and
the demonstration proves exactly as much without it.  That removes a hazard
rather than redacting one.
