"""Track B — mid-run fault injection (adversarial validation).

Sabotages MockMed state BETWEEN steps of a live replay via ``ChaosBackend``
and pins down halt-vs-improvise behavior. The silent wrong-patient save and
the silent empty-note save originally found here were FIXED on 2026-07-08
(pre-click identity check + typed-input verification); their tests now pin
the safe-halt / recovery behavior. See ``docs/validation/VALIDATION.md``
for the ranked matrix.

Click order in the canonical demo: 1=username 2=password 3=sign-in 4=Open
5=New Encounter 6=Triage 7=note field 8=Save. Type order: 1=username
2=password 3=note.
