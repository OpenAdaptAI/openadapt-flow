"""Opt-in Citrix-Workspace-backend e2e over the no-DOM canvas STAND-IN.

Gated by ``OAFLOW_CITRIX_STANDIN_E2E=1`` (needs Docker + the flow stack with
cv2/rapidocr + a Playwright chromium). Builds the Part-1 canvas fixture
(``benchmark/canvas_ladder/fixture``), then drives the
``CitrixWorkspaceBackend`` (window-scoped capture + actuation + all fail-loud
safety gates) over that no-DOM ``<canvas>`` through the ``WindowClient`` seam,
and asserts the contract across three trials per condition:

  * healthy record->compile->replay succeeds with ZERO model calls, VISUAL rungs
    only (structural never used), the write EFFECT independently confirmed;
  * severe (illegible) drift HALTS with no write and no model call.

This is the no-DOM-canvas STAND-IN (Citrix Workspace-WEB class), NOT ICA/HDX.
See ``benchmark/citrix_workspace/README.md``.
