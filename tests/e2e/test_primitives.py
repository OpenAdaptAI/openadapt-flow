"""Track C — interaction-primitive taxonomy (adversarial validation).

For each interaction primitive the widgets lab page
(``openadapt_flow/mockmed/static/widgets.html?panel=<name>``) exposes one
control; each test records a tiny demonstration against it, compiles, and
replays on a fresh page. The support matrix these tests back — including
the primitives that are unsupported STRUCTURALLY (file upload,
drag-and-drop, conditional branching, multi-window) and therefore have no
test here — lives in ``docs/validation/VALIDATION.md`` and
``docs/LIMITS.md``.

Several tests are characterizations of weak behavior (vacuous successes on
steps that compiled with zero postconditions; position-based resolution of
parameterized typeahead). The wrong-row click under reorder was FIXED on
2026-07-08 (pre-click identity check) — its test now pins the safe-halt.
Comments state the desired behavior where it differs from the observed one.
