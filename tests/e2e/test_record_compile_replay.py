"""E2E: record the MockMed demo once, compile it, replay it under drift.

Matrix (DESIGN.md "Test policy"):

- baseline x3: all-template resolution, zero heals.
- params: replay with a note value DIFFERENT from the recorded one succeeds
  and the new value is verified via banner OCR (the identity case cannot
  distinguish real substitution from replaying the baked-in literal).
- theme / move / rename: succeed WITH heals, then the healed bundle replays
  all-template.
- modal: fails gracefully, naming the failing step + postcondition.
- risk gate: an irreversible step that only resolves below the ocr rung
  refuses to act.
- CLI smoke: demo-record -> compile -> replay (different param value) ->
  emit-skill round-trip.

The recording/compile are session-shared (see conftest); every replay uses a
fresh browser page so MockMed state never leaks between scenarios.
