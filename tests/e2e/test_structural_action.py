"""End-to-end: the structural (DOM) ACTION rung as the product DEFAULT.

The record -> compile -> replay characterization suites in this package run
with ``use_structural=False`` so they keep pinning the VISUAL fallback floor
(the pixel-only / RDP-Citrix substrate path). This module pins the DEFAULT
product behavior on a structure-bearing backend (MockMed is a real DOM app):
the runtime resolves each recorded target as a DOM element and acts on it
deterministically, with the identity and risk gates unchanged.

The resolution-level availability win under render drift (structural 21/21 vs
visual 6/21) is measured in ``openadapt_flow/validation/structural_action.py``
and asserted in ``tests/test_structural_rung.py``; here we prove the same rung
drives a full record->compile->replay on MockMed and preserves the headline
no-wrong-write safety property under cosmetic drift.
