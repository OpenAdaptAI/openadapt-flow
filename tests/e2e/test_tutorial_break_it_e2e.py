"""Rejected-write tutorial simulation, end to end.

The clean free path is pinned by :mod:`test_free_path_e2e` (golden task).  This
module covers the OTHER half of the tutorial's demonstration: the SAME
certified bundle, rerun against a backend that rejects the write AFTER the
application has painted its success banner (``?fault=optimistic``).  Every
on-screen check passes; only the independent read of the system of record can
tell the truth -- and the run must end HALTED because of it.

What is asserted, on one real browser run:

* the clean half still terminates ``VERIFIED`` with its receipt;
* the broken half terminates ``HALTED`` / ``RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED``, not
  billable, with the declared ``record_written`` effect REFUTED at
  INDEPENDENT_SYSTEM strength while zero rows exist in the store;
* the lie was real: the consequential step's on-screen postconditions all
  PASSED on the broken run -- the halt did not come from the screen;
* the caught fault leaves a clearly-labeled LOCAL report
  (``run-rejected-write/REPORT.md`` leads with ``HALTED``) and NO shareable
  receipt,
  and ``report-run`` still refuses the halted run -- the success rail was not
  weakened to make the fault showable.
