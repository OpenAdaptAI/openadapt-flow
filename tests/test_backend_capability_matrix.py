"""Executable capability matrix: which OPTIONAL protocols each backend exposes.

The runtime touches a GUI only through :class:`openadapt_flow.backend.Backend`,
but several *optional* capabilities are advertised structurally -- the resolver
and identity ladder call ``isinstance(backend, StructuralActionBackend)`` /
``IdentityBackend`` / ``SystemOfRecordBackend`` and fall through UNCHANGED when a
substrate does not implement them (``docs/LIMITS.md``, ``backend.py`` protocol
docstrings). Because that conformance is what decides whether a backend gets a
deterministic structural rung, a structured-text identity check, or an
independent system-of-record effect oracle, it is a load-bearing part of each
backend's *maturity*, and the published maturity map
(``docs/PRODUCT_STATUS.md`` / ``docs/LIMITS.md``) is only honest if it matches
the code.

This test pins that map in executable form. Each backend's exposed optional
protocols are asserted against an EXPECTED matrix; a drift in either direction
fails loudly:

* Adding a capability to a backend (e.g. teaching macOS AX identity) without
  updating this matrix -- and, by the review it forces, ``PRODUCT_STATUS.md`` --
  fails.
* Silently DROPPING a capability (a refactor that stops a backend implementing a
  protocol the runtime relies on) fails.

It also guards two specific honesty facts the audit surfaced:

* No backend advertises :class:`SystemOfRecordBackend`. System-of-record effect
  verification is provided by a configured external verifier
  (``deployment.build_effect_verifier``), never fabricated by a backend claiming
  to read the app's authoritative store.
* The pixel-only substrates (RDP network + local remote-display/Citrix analog)
  and the native macOS backend advertise NO structured/identity capability, so
  identity honestly falls through to the OCR ladder (macOS/pixel) rather than a
  structured check that substrate cannot back.

Membership is derived from each protocol's own ``__protocol_attrs__`` rather than
hard-coded, so extending a protocol's surface is reflected automatically and a
partial (some-but-not-all-members) implementation cannot masquerade as full
conformance.
