"""Continuous skill learning: the versioned, governed learn/promote loop.

Exercises the loop end-to-end over a SYNTHETIC drift stream (no live app, no
model calls):

- a new dialog appears mid-stream -> the loop detects the novelty, induces +
  validates + PROMOTES a revised program that covers it (and the version history
  reflects it);
- a batch of only noise/failures (no novel successful structure) -> NO promotion
  (stability);
- a candidate that would REGRESS identity / effect / risk (via a rigged inducer)
  -> REJECTED by the regression gate reused from PR #70, active version retained;
- a novelty the (additive) inducer cannot cover -> the canary refuses the
  inadequate candidate;
- the symbolic Phase-2 coverage interpreter and the versioned SkillLibrary units.

The inducer is always a deterministic STUB (the reference structural inducer, or
a purpose-built rigged one) -- the real multi-trace inducer is a sibling PR wired
in at merge via the ``Inducer`` Protocol.
