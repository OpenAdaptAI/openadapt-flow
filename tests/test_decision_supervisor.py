"""The loop that makes the hosted lane real, and what it refuses to do.

``decision_relay`` proved the wire. This file proves the two things a wire
cannot: that an open pause becomes answerable **without anyone calling
anything**, and that an answer is applied to the pause it was minted from
rather than to whichever run happened to be in hand.

The second is the one worth the most scrutiny. ``DecisionRelay.serve_once``
takes its run and item as arguments, which is safe only when exactly one pause
is open. A practice with two halted runs is the ordinary case, not the exotic
one, so ``test_a_decision_is_executed_against_the_pause_it_was_minted_from``
opens two and answers the second.
