"""Durable tiered runtime (RFC §5, Tier 3): checkpoint + pause + resume.

Drives the REAL Replayer with a faked backend/vision (as in ``test_replayer``)
and a scripted in-memory ``EffectVerifier`` -- no Playwright, no OCR stack, no
network, no model call. The theses these pin:

* a clean run writes one checkpoint per verified step and completes;
* a run that HALTs mid-way (a REFUTED effect) writes a ``PendingEscalation``
  plus checkpoints for the PRIOR verified steps, and does not die silently;
* ``resume`` continues from the LAST verified checkpoint -- it re-executes only
  the paused step onward and NEVER re-runs an already-confirmed step (no
  re-performed / double write);
* escalation pauses deterministically for an operator; it never hands the
  remaining workflow to a free-form agent.
