"""CI guard for the end-to-end silent-wrong-effect (SWER) harness.

Runs a small N of the REAL harness (no model calls, localhost only) and asserts
the qualitative claims the harness exists to publish, so the measured numbers
can never silently regress:

- every write goes through the REAL replayer's api tier (not raw requests);
- **screen-verify** has a large NONZERO end-to-end silent-wrong-effect rate on
  the 2xx-but-wrong persistence faults (the banner accepts wrong writes);
- **effect-verify (REST record oracle)** drives that rate WAY down by reading
  the record out of band -- but does NOT reach zero: the collateral write to an
  unaudited surface slips its read path (the honest structural limit); and
- **effect-verify (complete SQL read path)** closes that gap and reaches zero.

It also asserts the THREE paths are actually distinct (the anti-circularity
property the older definitional benchmark lacks): the ground truth reads the
sqlite file directly and disagrees with the screen arm on the wrong-effect
faults, and each arm's decision is the replayer's real halt/pass.
