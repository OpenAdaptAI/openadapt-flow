"""Reference Execute server: a fault after dispatch never claims "no effect".

``failed_platform`` means the platform failed before any possible business
effect, so a caller may safely resubmit. Once the runner has been called, a
write may have landed, and the only honest terminal outcome for an
unclassifiable run is ``reconciliation_required`` with uncertain delivery.
