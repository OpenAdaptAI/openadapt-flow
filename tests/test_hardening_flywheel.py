"""CI gate for the vision-hardening flywheel — the monotone silent-wrong ratchet.

These tests are the enforcement half of the flywheel
(``openadapt_flow/validation/hardening/``). They run the REAL resolver over the
TEMPLATE-tier fixture x perturbation sweep (font-free, cv2-deterministic, ~5s)
and assert:

1. the sweep is deterministic (the ratchet is meaningful),
2. every fixture resolves CORRECTLY on the unperturbed control (the resolver is
   not broken, and a future hardening fix has not over-hardened it into halting
   on clean input),
3. **the silent-wrong count does not exceed the committed ratchet** — the
   monotone gate: it can only ever go DOWN,
4. the committed failure corpus is faithful to HEAD (freeze discipline), and
5. the seeded adversarial search deterministically finds confident-wrong cases.

The OCR tier is exercised by the CLI (``python -m
openadapt_flow.validation.hardening``) and reported in ``results.json`` but is
NOT gated here (RapidOCR output varies across engine/platform versions).
