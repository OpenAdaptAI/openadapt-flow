"""Induction HARDENING: the compiler must refuse to over-certify.

Both external reviews flagged that multi-trace induction is a useful PROTOTYPE
whose output can over-claim. These tests pin the safety posture the hardening
adds on top of ``tests/test_induction.py`` (which pins the happy paths):

1. A flagged Proposal over a CONSEQUENTIAL action does NOT auto-certify -- it
   also emits an :class:`Uncertainty`, so ``certified`` is False until an
   operator confirms. "Absent in some traces" is NOT a silent skip for a
   consequential step -- it becomes a question.
2. The trace-shape validator is named honestly (``structural_trace_coverage``),
   the misleading old name still works but is DEPRECATED, and neither is treated
   as behavioral / certification evidence.
3. A varying selection (which-entity) target becomes a parameter OR an
   Uncertainty -- NEVER a silently frozen demo entity.
4. An ambiguous / consequential loop yields an Uncertainty, not a bogus loop.

All deterministic and model-free (no backend, no VLM).
