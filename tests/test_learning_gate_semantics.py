"""The program regression gate compares program SEMANTICS, not step IDs.

Both external reviews of the halt->learn loop found the same hole: the gate only
checked the per-step identity/effect/risk of step ids that SURVIVE from the
active program into the candidate. A candidate could therefore silently

  * remove an identity-armed safety step (no surviving id -> never gated),
  * remove a system-of-record effect verification,
  * replace a consequential step with a NEW id,
  * add a new irreversible step with NO effects,
  * downgrade a write's risk or drop its operator-confirmation requirement, or
  * broaden a write's execution domain (make it reachable under more conditions)

and still PASS. These tests pin the fix: each weakening must QUARANTINE the
candidate (the gate fails) and leave the active version unchanged, while a benign
improvement that touches no consequential action still PASSES.

Steps are matched across versions by structural ROLE (action kind + intent), not
raw ``step.id`` -- so a renamed-but-equivalent write is still recognised as the
SAME action (no false alarm) and a genuinely-new consequential step is caught.
