"""CI guard for the O2C reconciliation multi-system benchmark.

Runs the REAL harness once (n=1; deterministic, localhost only, zero model
calls) and pins the qualitative claims the committed
``benchmark/o2c_recon/results.json`` publishes:

- the healthy path spans TWO separate fixture applications plus two
  spreadsheet surfaces (exported worklist in; results sheet written back and
  re-read from disk), 25+ executed actions, and is classified ``VERIFIED``
  under the governed standard profile with ZERO model calls;
- a billed order with no ledger entry routes to an explicit HALT terminal
  (never auto-created);
- ambiguous duplicate ledger entries and a stale reconciliation snapshot are
  refused at the UI gateway BEFORE anything is written;
- a phantom results-sheet write (acknowledged but never persisted) is CAUGHT
  by the governed arm re-reading the file and silently accepted by the
  banner-oracle arm;
- the independent ground truth (direct SQLite + CSV reads) agrees.
