"""Live-local tests for the API/tool actuator tier (top of the capability ladder).

These drive the REAL Replayer wired with a REAL
:class:`~openadapt_flow.runtime.actuators.ApiActuator` against a REAL system of
record (the in-process MockMed ``fault_server``), confirmed by the same
:class:`~openadapt_flow.runtime.effects.RestRecordVerifier` the GUI-write
effects tests use. No model calls, no network beyond localhost -- runs in CI.

The theses these pin (RFC ``docs/design/WORKFLOW_PROGRAM_IR.md`` section 4, the
``api`` implementation of a transition contract):

- a step with a REACHABLE ``ApiBinding`` performs its write via the API, the
  EffectVerifier CONFIRMS it against the record, and the GUI actuation is
  SKIPPED entirely -- ``$0``, zero model calls;
- an API response loss verifies the complete contract without retry or GUI
  fallback because the write can already have committed;
- a step with NO binding replays byte-identically to today (back-compat);
- a REFUTED effect after an API write HALTS (the record, not the screen, is the
  oracle);
- an API write whose outcome is unknown / rejected HALTs (never GUI-retried).
