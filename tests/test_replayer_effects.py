"""Live-local tests for EffectVerifier wiring in the Replayer.

These drive the REAL Replayer against a REAL system of record (the in-process
MockMed ``fault_server``) via the ``RestRecordVerifier`` from PR #63 -- the
same verifier the fault-model study judges by. The backend and vision are
faked (as in ``test_replayer``), but the write lands in the fault server's
ground-truth DB, so the effect check reads the actual record, never the
screen. No model calls, no network beyond localhost -- runs in CI.

The thesis these pin: a step whose SCREEN postcondition PASSES (the app
painted "Saved") is still HALTED when the system of record disagrees
(phantom / duplicate / partial write), and a genuinely correct write is
CONFIRMED and proceeds. A no-effects bundle behaves exactly as before, and a
step that declares effects with no verifier configured HALTS (fail-safe).
